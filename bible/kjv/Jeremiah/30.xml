      <verse>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
</verse><verse>Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
</verse><verse>For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And these <supplied>are</supplied> the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
</verse><verse>Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
</verse><verse>Alas! for that day <supplied>is</supplied> great, so that none <supplied>is</supplied> like it: it <supplied>is</supplied> even the time of Jacob&#x2019;s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
</verse><verse>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <supplied>that</supplied> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
</verse><verse>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and
none shall make <supplied>him</supplied> afraid.
</verse><verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether
unpunished.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise <supplied>is</supplied> incurable, <supplied>and</supplied> thy wound <supplied>is</supplied> grievous.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
</verse><verse>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; <supplied>because</supplied> thy sins were increased.
</verse><verse>Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <supplied>is</supplied> incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <supplied>because</supplied> thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
</verse><verse>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
</verse><verse>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, <supplied>saying,</supplied> This <supplied>is</supplied> Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob&#x2019;s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
</verse><verse>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
</verse><verse>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
</verse><verse>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <supplied>is</supplied> this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the
LORD.
</verse><verse>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
</verse><verse>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
</verse><verse>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done <supplied>it,</supplied> and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.
