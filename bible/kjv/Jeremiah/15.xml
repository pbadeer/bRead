<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Jeremiah" n="15">
      <verse>Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, <supplied>yet</supplied> my mind <supplied>could</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> toward this people: cast <supplied>them</supplied> out of my sight, and let them go forth.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as <supplied>are</supplied> for death, to death; and such as <supplied>are</supplied> for the sword, to the sword; and such as <supplied>are</supplied>
for the famine, to the famine; and such as <supplied>are</supplied> for the captivity, to the captivity.
</verse><verse>And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
</verse><verse>And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for <supplied>that</supplied> which he did in Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
</verse><verse>Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
</verse><verse>And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave <supplied>them</supplied> of children, I will destroy my people, <supplied>since</supplied> they return not from their ways.
</verse><verse>Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused <supplied>him</supplied> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
</verse><verse>She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while <supplied>it was</supplied> yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the
LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; <supplied>yet</supplied> every one of them doth curse me.
</verse><verse>The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <supplied>well</supplied> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
</verse><verse>Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
</verse><verse>Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <supplied>that</supplied> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
</verse><verse>And I will make <supplied>thee</supplied> to pass with thine enemies into a land <supplied>which</supplied> thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, <supplied>which</supplied> shall burn upon you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
</verse><verse>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.
</verse><verse>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
</verse><verse>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <supplied>which</supplied> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <supplied>and as</supplied> waters <supplied>that</supplied> fail?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <supplied>and</supplied> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou
unto them.
</verse><verse>And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I <supplied>am</supplied> with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
