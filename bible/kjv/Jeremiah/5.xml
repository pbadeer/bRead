<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Jeremiah" n="5" book-chapters="52">
      <verse>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <supplied>any</supplied> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
</verse><verse>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
</verse><verse>O LORD, <supplied>are</supplied> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <supplied>but</supplied> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have
refused to return.
</verse><verse>Therefore I said, Surely these <supplied>are</supplied> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <supplied>nor</supplied> the judgment of their God.
</verse><verse>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <supplied>and</supplied> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <supplied>and</supplied> burst the bonds.
</verse><verse>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <supplied>and</supplied> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many,
<supplied>and</supplied> their backslidings are increased.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <supplied>them that are</supplied> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots&#x2019; houses.
</verse><verse>They were <supplied>as</supplied> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour&#x2019;s wife.
</verse><verse>Shall I not visit for these <supplied>things?</supplied> saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <supplied>are</supplied> not the LORD&#x2019;S.
</verse><verse>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>They have belied the LORD, and said, <supplied>It is</supplied> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
</verse><verse>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <supplied>is</supplied> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
</verse><verse>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
</verse><verse>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <supplied>is</supplied> a mighty nation, it <supplied>is</supplied> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
</verse><verse>Their quiver <supplied>is</supplied> as an open sepulchre, they <supplied>are</supplied> all mighty men.
</verse><verse>And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <supplied>which</supplied> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities,
wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <supplied>things</supplied> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a
land <supplied>that is</supplied> not yours.
</verse><verse>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
</verse><verse>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
</verse><verse>Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand <supplied>for</supplied> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not
prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
</verse><verse>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
</verse><verse>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Your iniquities have turned away these <supplied>things,</supplied> and your sins have withholden good <supplied>things</supplied> from you.
</verse><verse>For among my people are found wicked <supplied>men:</supplied> they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
</verse><verse>As a cage is full of birds, so <supplied>are</supplied> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
</verse><verse>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
</verse><verse>Shall I not visit for these <supplied>things?</supplied> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
</verse><verse>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love <supplied>to have it</supplied> so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
     
      </verse>
