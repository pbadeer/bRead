      <verse>The word that the LORD spake against Babylon <supplied>and</supplied> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
</verse><verse>Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <supplied>and</supplied> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
</verse><verse>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
</verse><verse>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <supplied>that</supplied> shall not be forgotten.
</verse><verse>My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <supplied>on</supplied> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
</verse><verse>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
</verse><verse>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows <supplied>shall be</supplied> as of a mighty
expert man; none shall return in vain.
</verse><verse>And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
</verse><verse>Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <supplied>shall be</supplied> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
</verse><verse>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
</verse><verse>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.
</verse><verse>Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <supplied>is</supplied> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
</verse><verse>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Israel <supplied>is</supplied> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <supplied>him</supplied> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
</verse><verse>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
</verse><verse>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <supplied>there shall be</supplied> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Go up against the land of Merathaim, <supplied>even</supplied> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
</verse><verse>A sound of battle <supplied>is</supplied> in the land, and of great destruction.
</verse><verse>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
</verse><verse>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.
</verse><verse>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this <supplied>is</supplied> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
</verse><verse>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
</verse><verse>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
</verse><verse>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
</verse><verse>Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against
the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, <supplied>O thou</supplied> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <supplied>that</supplied> I will visit thee.
</verse><verse>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah <supplied>were</supplied> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
</verse><verse>Their Redeemer <supplied>is</supplied> strong; the LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A sword <supplied>is</supplied> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <supplied>men. </supplied></verse><verse>A sword <supplied>is</supplied> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword <supplied>is</supplied> upon her mighty
men; and they shall be dismayed.
</verse><verse>A sword <supplied>is</supplied> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that <supplied>are</supplied> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword <supplied>is</supplied> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
</verse><verse>A drought <supplied>is</supplied> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it <supplied>is</supplied> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon <supplied>their</supplied> idols.
</verse><verse>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell <supplied>there,</supplied> and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
</verse><verse>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <supplied>cities</supplied> thereof, saith the LORD; <supplied>so</supplied> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
</verse><verse>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
</verse><verse>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <supplied>are</supplied> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, <supplied>every one</supplied> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of
Babylon.
</verse><verse>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <supplied>and</supplied> pangs as of a woman in travail.
</verse><verse>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who <supplied>is</supplied> a chosen <supplied>man, that</supplied> I may appoint over her? for who <supplied>is</supplied> like
me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <supplied>is</supplied> that shepherd that will stand before me?
</verse><verse>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make <supplied>their</supplied>
habitation desolate with them.
</verse><verse>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
