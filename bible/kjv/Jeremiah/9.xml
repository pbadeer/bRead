<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Jeremiah" n="9">
      <verse>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
</verse><verse>Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they <supplied>be</supplied> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
</verse><verse>And they bend their tongues <supplied>like</supplied> their bow <supplied>for</supplied> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
</verse><verse>And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, <supplied>and</supplied> weary themselves to commit iniquity.
</verse><verse>Thine habitation <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?
</verse><verse>Their tongue <supplied>is as</supplied> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: <supplied>one</supplied> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Shall I not visit them for these <supplied>things?</supplied> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
</verse><verse>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through <supplied>them;</supplied> neither can <supplied>men</supplied> hear the voice of the cattle; both
the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
</verse><verse>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <supplied>and</supplied> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> the wise man, that may understand this? and <supplied>who is he</supplied> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth <supplied>and</supplied> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
</verse><verse>And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;
</verse><verse>But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, <supplied>even</supplied> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
</verse><verse>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning <supplied>women,</supplied> that they may come:
</verse><verse>And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
</verse><verse>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast <supplied>us</supplied> out.
</verse><verse>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.
</verse><verse>For death is come up into our windows, <supplied>and</supplied> is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, <supplied>and</supplied> the young men from the streets.
</verse><verse>Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather <supplied>them.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise <supplied>man</supplied> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <supplied>man</supplied> glory in his might, let not the rich <supplied>man</supplied> glory in his riches:
</verse><verse>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <supplied>things</supplied> I delight, saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <supplied>them which are</supplied> circumcised with the uncircumcised;
</verse><verse>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <supplied>that are</supplied> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <supplied>these</supplied> nations <supplied>are</supplied> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <supplied>are</supplied>
uncircumcised in the heart.
