      <verse>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
</verse><verse>For the customs of the people <supplied>are</supplied> vain: for <supplied>one</supplied> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
</verse><verse>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
</verse><verse>They <supplied>are</supplied> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <supplied>is it</supplied> in them to do good.
</verse><verse>Forasmuch as <supplied>there is</supplied> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou <supplied>art</supplied> great, and thy name is great in might.
</verse><verse>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <supplied>men</supplied> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, <supplied>there is</supplied> none like unto thee.
</verse><verse>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <supplied>is</supplied> a doctrine of vanities.
</verse><verse>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they <supplied>are</supplied> all the work of cunning <supplied>men. </supplied></verse><verse>But the LORD
<supplied>is</supplied> the true God, he <supplied>is</supplied> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
</verse><verse>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, <supplied>even</supplied> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
</verse><verse>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
</verse><verse>When he uttereth his voice, <supplied>there is</supplied> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
</verse><verse>Every man is brutish in <supplied>his</supplied> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and <supplied>there is</supplied> no breath in them.
</verse><verse>They <supplied>are</supplied> vanity, <supplied>and</supplied> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
</verse><verse>The portion of Jacob <supplied>is</supplied> not like them: for he <supplied>is</supplied> the former of all <supplied>things;</supplied> and Israel <supplied>is</supplied> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> his name.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find <supplied>it</supplied> so.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this <supplied>is</supplied> a grief, and I must bear it.
</verse><verse>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they <supplied>are</supplied> not: <supplied>there is</supplied> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
</verse><verse>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
</verse><verse>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <supplied>and</supplied> a den of dragons.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O LORD, I know that the way of man <supplied>is</supplied> not in himself: <supplied>it is</supplied> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
</verse><verse>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
</verse><verse>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
