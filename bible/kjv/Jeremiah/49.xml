      <verse>Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why <supplied>then</supplied> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
</verse><verse>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that
were his heirs, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <supplied>and</supplied> his priests and his princes together.
</verse><verse>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Who shall come unto me?
</verse><verse>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

      <verse>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <supplied>Is</supplied> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
</verse><verse>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <supplied>that</supplied> I will visit him.
</verse><verse>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <supplied>some</supplied> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
</verse><verse>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
</verse><verse>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <supplied>them</supplied> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment <supplied>was</supplied> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <supplied>art</supplied> thou he <supplied>that</supplied> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink
<supplied>of it. </supplied></verse><verse>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
</verse><verse>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
</verse><verse>For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <supplied>and</supplied> despised among men.
</verse><verse>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <supplied>and</supplied> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down
from thence, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
</verse><verse>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <supplied>cities</supplied> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
</verse><verse>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who <supplied>is</supplied> a chosen <supplied>man, that</supplied> I may appoint over her? for who <supplied>is</supplied>
like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <supplied>is</supplied> that shepherd that will stand before me?
</verse><verse>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations
desolate with them.
</verse><verse>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
</verse><verse>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

      <verse>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <supplied>there is</supplied> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
</verse><verse>Damascus is waxed feeble, <supplied>and</supplied> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on <supplied>her:</supplied> anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
</verse><verse>How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
</verse><verse>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.

      <verse>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
</verse><verse>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <supplied>is</supplied> on every side.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
</verse><verse>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, <supplied>which</supplied> dwell alone.
</verse><verse>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them <supplied>that are</supplied> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <supplied>and</supplied> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <supplied>any</supplied> son of man dwell in it.

</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
</verse><verse>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
</verse><verse>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them <supplied>even</supplied> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
</verse><verse>And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <supplied>that</supplied> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.
