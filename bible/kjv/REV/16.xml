      <verse>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <supplied>upon</supplied> them which worshipped his image.
</verse><verse>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <supplied>man:</supplied> and every living soul died in the sea.
</verse><verse>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
</verse><verse>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
</verse><verse>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
</verse><verse>And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <supplied>are</supplied> thy judgments.
</verse><verse>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
</verse><verse>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
</verse><verse>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
</verse><verse>And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
</verse><verse>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
</verse><verse>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <supplied>come</supplied> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
</verse><verse>For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <supplied>which</supplied> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
</verse><verse><jesus>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. </jesus></verse><verse>And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
</verse><verse>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
</verse><verse>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <supplied>and</supplied> so great.
</verse><verse>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
</verse><verse>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
</verse><verse>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <supplied>every stone</supplied> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
