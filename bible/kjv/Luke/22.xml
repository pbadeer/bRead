      <verse>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
</verse><verse>And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
</verse><verse>And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
</verse><verse>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
</verse><verse>And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
</verse><verse>And he sent Peter and John, saying, <jesus>Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. </jesus></verse><verse>And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The
Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. </jesus></verse><verse>And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and
they made ready the passover.
</verse><verse>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. </jesus></verse><verse>And he took the cup,
and gave thanks, and said, <jesus>Take this, and divide <supplied>it</supplied> among yourselves: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake <supplied>it,</supplied> and gave unto them, saying, <jesus>This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. </jesus></verse><verse>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, <jesus>This cup <supplied>is</supplied>
the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <supplied>is</supplied> with me on the table. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! </jesus></verse><verse>And they began to enquire among
themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But ye <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> so: but he that is greatest among you, let
him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For whether <supplied>is</supplied> greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? <supplied>is</supplied> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And the Lord said, <jesus>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <supplied>to have</supplied> you, that he may sift <supplied>you</supplied> as wheat: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
</verse><verse>And he said, <jesus>I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?</jesus>
And they said, Nothing.
</verse><verse>Then said he unto them, <jesus>But now, he that hath a purse, let him take <supplied>it,</supplied> and likewise <supplied>his</supplied> scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I say unto you, that this that is written
must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. </jesus></verse><verse>And they said, Lord, behold, here <supplied>are</supplied> two swords. And he said unto them, <jesus>It is enough.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
</verse><verse>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, <jesus>Pray that ye enter not into temptation. </jesus></verse><verse>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone&#x2019;s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
</verse><verse>Saying, <jesus>Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. </jesus></verse><verse>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
</verse><verse>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
</verse><verse>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
</verse><verse>And said unto them, <jesus>Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
</verse><verse>But Jesus said unto him, <jesus>Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? </jesus></verse><verse>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
</verse><verse>And Jesus answered and said, <jesus>Suffer ye thus far.</jesus> And he touched his ear, and healed him.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, <jesus>Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched
forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Then took they him, and led <supplied>him,</supplied> and brought him into the high priest&#x2019;s house. And Peter followed afar off.
</verse><verse>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
</verse><verse>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
</verse><verse>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
</verse><verse>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
</verse><verse>And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this <supplied>fellow</supplied> also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
</verse><verse>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
</verse><verse>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, <jesus>Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </jesus></verse><verse>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote <supplied>him. </supplied></verse><verse>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
</verse><verse>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
</verse><verse>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, <jesus>If I tell you, ye will not believe: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if I also ask <supplied>you,</supplied> ye will not answer me, nor let <supplied>me</supplied> go. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the
right hand of the power of God. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, <jesus>Ye say that I am. </jesus></verse><verse>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
