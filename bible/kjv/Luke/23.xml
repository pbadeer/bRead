      <verse>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
</verse><verse>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <supplied>fellow</supplied> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
</verse><verse>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <jesus>Thou sayest <supplied>it. </supplied></jesus></verse><verse>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <supplied>to</supplied> the people, I find no fault in this man.
</verse><verse>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
</verse><verse>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
</verse><verse>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herodâ€™s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <supplied>season,</supplied> because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
</verse><verse>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
</verse><verse>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
</verse><verse>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <supplied>him,</supplied> and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
</verse><verse>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <supplied>him</supplied> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
</verse><verse>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
</verse><verse>I will therefore chastise him, and release <supplied>him. </supplied></verse><verse>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
</verse><verse>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <supplied>man,</supplied> and release unto us Barabbas:
</verse><verse>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
</verse><verse>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
</verse><verse>But they cried, saying, Crucify <supplied>him,</supplied> crucify him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <supplied>him</supplied> go.
</verse><verse>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
</verse><verse>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
</verse><verse>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
</verse><verse>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <supplied>it</supplied> after Jesus.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
</verse><verse>But Jesus turning unto them said, <jesus>Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <supplied>are</supplied> the barren, and the
wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
</jesus></verse><verse>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
</verse><verse>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said Jesus, <jesus>Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</jesus> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
</verse><verse>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <supplied>him,</supplied> saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
</verse><verse>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
</verse><verse>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
</verse><verse>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
</verse><verse>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
</verse><verse>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
</verse><verse>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
</verse><verse>And Jesus said unto him, <jesus>Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. </jesus></verse><verse>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
</verse><verse>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <jesus>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. </jesus></verse><verse>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a
righteous man.
</verse><verse>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
</verse><verse>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And, behold, <supplied>there was</supplied> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <supplied>and he was</supplied> a good man, and a just:
</verse><verse>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <supplied>he was</supplied> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>man</supplied> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
</verse><verse>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
</verse><verse>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
</verse><verse>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
</verse><verse>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
