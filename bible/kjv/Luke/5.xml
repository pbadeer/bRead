      <verse>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
</verse><verse>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <supplied>their</supplied> nets.
</verse><verse>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
</verse><verse>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <jesus>Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. </jesus></verse><verse>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy
word I will let down the net.
</verse><verse>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
</verse><verse>And they beckoned unto <supplied>their</supplied> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
</verse><verse>When Simon Peter saw <supplied>it,</supplied> he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
</verse><verse>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
</verse><verse>And so <supplied>was</supplied> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <jesus>Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. </jesus></verse><verse>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
all, and followed him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <supplied>his</supplied> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</verse><verse>And he put forth <supplied>his</supplied> hand, and touched him, saying, <jesus>I will: be thou clean.</jesus> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
</verse><verse>And he charged him to tell no man: <jesus>but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. </jesus></verse><verse>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <supplied>present</supplied> to
heal them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <supplied>means</supplied> to bring him in, and to lay <supplied>him</supplied> before him.
</verse><verse>And when they could not find by what <supplied>way</supplied> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <supplied>his</supplied> couch into the midst before Jesus.
</verse><verse>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <jesus>Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. </jesus></verse><verse>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
</verse><verse>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <jesus>What reason ye in your hearts? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But that ye may know that
the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</jesus> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <jesus>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. </jesus></verse><verse>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he
lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
</verse><verse>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <jesus>Follow me. </jesus></verse><verse>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
</verse><verse>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
</verse><verse>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
</verse><verse>And Jesus answering said unto them, <jesus>They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <supplied>the disciples</supplied> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those
days.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he spake also a parable unto them; <jesus>No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <supplied>taken</supplied> out of the new agreeth not with the old. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And
no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>No man also having drunk
old <supplied>wine</supplied> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.
