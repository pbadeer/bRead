      <verse>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
</verse><verse>And a certain centurion&#x2019;s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
</verse><verse>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
</verse><verse>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
</verse><verse>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
</verse><verse>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
</verse><verse>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled
at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <jesus>I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </jesus></verse><verse>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been
sick.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
</verse><verse>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
</verse><verse>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <jesus>Weep not. </jesus></verse><verse>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <supplied>him</supplied> stood still. And he said, <jesus>Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. </jesus></verse><verse>And he
that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
</verse><verse>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.
</verse><verse>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
</verse><verse>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And John calling <supplied>unto him</supplied> two of his disciples sent <supplied>them</supplied> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
</verse><verse>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
</verse><verse>And in that same hour he cured many of <supplied>their</supplied> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <supplied>that were</supplied> blind he gave sight.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus answering said unto them, <jesus>Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And blessed is <supplied>he,</supplied> whosoever shall not be offended in me.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, <jesus>What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But what went ye out for to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>This is
<supplied>he,</supplied> of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but
he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. </jesus></verse><verse>And all the people that heard <supplied>him,</supplied> and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
</verse><verse>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the Lord said, <jesus>Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say,
Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But wisdom is justified of all her children.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee&#x2019;s house, and sat down to meat.
</verse><verse>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <supplied>Jesus</supplied> sat at meat in the Pharisee&#x2019;s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
</verse><verse>And stood at his feet behind <supplied>him</supplied> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <supplied>them</supplied> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <supplied>them</supplied> with the ointment.
</verse><verse>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <supplied>it,</supplied> he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <supplied>this is</supplied> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
</verse><verse>And Jesus answering said unto him, <jesus>Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.</jesus> And he saith, Master, say on.
</verse><verse><jesus>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
</jesus></verse><verse>Simon answered and said, I suppose that <supplied>he,</supplied> to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, <jesus>Thou hast rightly judged. </jesus></verse><verse>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, <jesus>Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine
house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <supplied>them</supplied> with the hairs of her head. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <supplied>the
same</supplied> loveth little. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto her, <jesus>Thy sins are forgiven. </jesus></verse><verse>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
</verse><verse>And he said to the woman, <jesus>Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
