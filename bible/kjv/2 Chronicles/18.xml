      <verse>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
</verse><verse>And after <supplied>certain</supplied> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that <supplied>he had</supplied> with him, and persuaded him to go up <supplied>with him</supplied> to Ramoth-gilead.
</verse><verse>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I <supplied>am</supplied> as thou <supplied>art,</supplied> and my people as thy people; and <supplied>we will be</supplied> with thee in the war.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
</verse><verse>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver <supplied>it</supplied> into the king&#x2019;s hand.
</verse><verse>But Jehoshaphat said, <supplied>Is there</supplied> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
</verse><verse>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <supplied>There is</supplied> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said,
Let not the king say so.
</verse><verse>And the king of Israel called for one <supplied>of his</supplied> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
</verse><verse>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in <supplied>their</supplied> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
</verse><verse>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
</verse><verse>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver <supplied>it</supplied> into the hand of the king.
</verse><verse>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets <supplied>declare</supplied> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
</verse><verse>And Micaiah said, <supplied>As</supplied> the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
</verse><verse>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
</verse><verse>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
</verse><verse>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return <supplied>therefore</supplied> every man to his house in peace.
</verse><verse>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee <supplied>that</supplied> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
</verse><verse>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <supplied>on</supplied> his left.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
</verse><verse>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
</verse><verse>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <supplied>the LORD</supplied> said, Thou shalt entice <supplied>him,</supplied> and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <supplied>even</supplied> so.
</verse><verse>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
</verse><verse>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
</verse><verse>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
</verse><verse>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king&#x2019;s son;
</verse><verse>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <supplied>fellow</supplied> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
</verse><verse>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <supplied>then</supplied> hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
</verse><verse>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
</verse><verse>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
</verse><verse>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that <supplied>were</supplied> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <supplied>is</supplied> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them
<supplied>to depart</supplied> from him.
</verse><verse>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
</verse><verse>And a <supplied>certain</supplied> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
</verse><verse>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed <supplied>himself</supplied> up in <supplied>his</supplied> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
