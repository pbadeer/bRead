      <verse>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
</verse><verse>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <supplied>of wine.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he appointed <supplied>certain</supplied> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:
</verse><verse>Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
</verse><verse>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then on that day David delivered first <supplied>this psalm</supplied> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
</verse><verse>Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
</verse><verse>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
</verse><verse>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
</verse><verse>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
</verse><verse>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
</verse><verse>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
</verse><verse>He <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD our God; his judgments <supplied>are</supplied> in all the earth.
</verse><verse>Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <supplied>which</supplied> he commanded to a thousand generations;
</verse><verse><supplied>Even of the covenant</supplied> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
</verse><verse>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <supplied>and</supplied> to Israel <supplied>for</supplied> an everlasting covenant,
</verse><verse>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
</verse><verse>When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>when</supplied> they went from nation to nation, and from <supplied>one</supplied> kingdom to another people;
</verse><verse>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
</verse><verse><supplied>Saying,</supplied> Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
</verse><verse>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.
</verse><verse>Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
</verse><verse>For great <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <supplied>is</supplied> to be feared above all gods.
</verse><verse>For all the gods of the people <supplied>are</supplied> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
</verse><verse>Glory and honour <supplied>are</supplied> in his presence; strength and gladness <supplied>are</supplied> in his place.
</verse><verse>Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
</verse><verse>Give unto the LORD the glory <supplied>due</supplied> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
</verse><verse>Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
</verse><verse>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <supplied>men</supplied> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
</verse><verse>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <supplied>is</supplied> therein.
</verse><verse>Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.
</verse><verse>O give thanks unto the LORD; for <supplied>he is</supplied> good; for his mercy <supplied>endureth</supplied> for ever.
</verse><verse>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <supplied>and</supplied> glory in thy praise.
</verse><verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day&#x2019;s work required:
</verse><verse>And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <supplied>to be</supplied> porters:
</verse><verse>And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <supplied>was</supplied> at Gibeon,
</verse><verse>To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <supplied>to do</supplied> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
</verse><verse>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <supplied>endureth</supplied> for ever;
</verse><verse>And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <supplied>were</supplied> porters.
</verse><verse>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
