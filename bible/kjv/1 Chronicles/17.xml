      <verse>Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <supplied>remaineth</supplied> under curtains.
</verse><verse>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God <supplied>is</supplied> with thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
</verse><verse>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:
</verse><verse>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <supplied>one</supplied> tabernacle <supplied>to another. </supplied></verse><verse>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of
the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?
</verse><verse>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <supplied>even</supplied> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:
</verse><verse>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <supplied>are</supplied> in the earth.
</verse><verse>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
</verse><verse>And since the time that I commanded judges <supplied>to be</supplied> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <supplied>to be</supplied> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
</verse><verse>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.
</verse><verse>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <supplied>it</supplied> from <supplied>him</supplied> that was before thee:
</verse><verse>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
</verse><verse>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <supplied>am</supplied> I, O LORD God, and what <supplied>is</supplied> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
</verse><verse>And <supplied>yet</supplied> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <supplied>also</supplied> spoken of thy servant&#x2019;s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
</verse><verse>What can David <supplied>speak</supplied> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
</verse><verse>O LORD, for thy servant&#x2019;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
</verse><verse>O LORD, <supplied>there is</supplied> none like thee, neither <supplied>is there any</supplied> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
</verse><verse>And what one nation in the earth <supplied>is</supplied> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <supplied>to be</supplied> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed
out of Egypt?
</verse><verse>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.
</verse><verse>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
</verse><verse>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> the God of Israel, <supplied>even</supplied> a God to Israel: and <supplied>let</supplied> the house of David thy servant <supplied>be</supplied> established before thee.
</verse><verse>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <supplied>in his heart</supplied> to pray before thee.
</verse><verse>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
</verse><verse>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <supplied>it shall be</supplied> blessed for ever.
