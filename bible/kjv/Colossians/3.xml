      <verse>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
</verse><verse>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
</verse><verse>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
</verse><verse>When Christ, <supplied>who is</supplied> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
</verse><verse>For which things&#x2019; sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
</verse><verse>In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
</verse><verse>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
</verse><verse>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
</verse><verse>And have put on the new <supplied>man,</supplied> which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
</verse><verse>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <supplied>nor</supplied> free: but Christ <supplied>is</supplied> all, and in all.
</verse><verse>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
</verse><verse>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also <supplied>do</supplied> ye.
</verse><verse>And above all these things <supplied>put on</supplied> charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
</verse><verse>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
</verse><verse>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
</verse><verse>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <supplied>do</supplied> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
</verse><verse>Husbands, love <supplied>your</supplied> wives, and be not bitter against them.
</verse><verse>Children, obey <supplied>your</supplied> parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
</verse><verse>Fathers, provoke not your children <supplied>to anger,</supplied> lest they be discouraged.
</verse><verse>Servants, obey in all things <supplied>your</supplied> masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
</verse><verse>And whatsoever ye do, do <supplied>it</supplied> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
</verse><verse>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
</verse><verse>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
