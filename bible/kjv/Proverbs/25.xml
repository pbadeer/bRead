      <verse>These <supplied>are</supplied> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <supplied>is</supplied> to search out a matter.
</verse><verse>The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <supplied>is</supplied> unsearchable.
</verse><verse>Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
</verse><verse>Take away the wicked <supplied>from</supplied> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
</verse><verse>Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <supplied>men: </supplied></verse><verse>For better <supplied>it is</supplied> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince
whom thine eyes have seen.
</verse><verse>Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <supplied>thou know not</supplied> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
</verse><verse>Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <supplied>himself;</supplied> and discover not a secret to another:
</verse><verse>Lest he that heareth <supplied>it</supplied> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
</verse><verse>A word fitly spoken <supplied>is like</supplied> apples of gold in pictures of silver.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <supplied>so is</supplied> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
</verse><verse>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <supplied>so is</supplied> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
</verse><verse>Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <supplied>is like</supplied> clouds and wind without rain.
</verse><verse>By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
</verse><verse>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
</verse><verse>Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour&#x2019;s house; lest he be weary of thee, and <supplied>so</supplied> hate thee.
</verse><verse>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <supplied>is</supplied> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
</verse><verse>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <supplied>is like</supplied> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <supplied>and as</supplied> vinegar upon nitre, so <supplied>is</supplied> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
</verse><verse>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
</verse><verse>For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
</verse><verse>The north wind driveth away rain: so <supplied>doth</supplied> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <supplied>is</supplied> good news from a far country.
</verse><verse>A righteous man falling down before the wicked <supplied>is as</supplied> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is </supplied>not good to eat much honey: so <supplied>for men </supplied>to search their own glory <supplied>is not </supplied>glory.
</verse><verse>He that <supplied>hath</supplied> no rule over his own spirit <supplied>is like</supplied> a city <supplied>that is</supplied> broken down, <supplied>and</supplied> without walls.
