      <verse>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
</verse><verse>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
</verse><verse>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
</verse><verse>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
</verse><verse>A wise <supplied>man</supplied> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
</verse><verse>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The fear of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> the beginning of knowledge: <supplied>but</supplied> fools despise wisdom and instruction.
</verse><verse>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
</verse><verse>For they <supplied>shall be</supplied> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
</verse><verse>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
</verse><verse>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
</verse><verse>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
</verse><verse>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
</verse><verse>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
</verse><verse>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
</verse><verse>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
</verse><verse>And they lay wait for their <supplied>own</supplied> blood; they lurk privily for their <supplied>own</supplied> lives.
</verse><verse>So <supplied>are</supplied> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <supplied>which</supplied> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
</verse><verse>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <supplied>saying, </supplied></verse><verse>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate
knowledge?
</verse><verse>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
</verse><verse>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
</verse><verse>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
</verse><verse>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
</verse><verse>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
</verse><verse>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
</verse><verse>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
</verse><verse>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
</verse><verse>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
     
      </verse>
