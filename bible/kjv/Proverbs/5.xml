<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="PRO" n="5">
      <verse>My son, attend unto my wisdom, <supplied>and</supplied> bow thine ear to my understanding:
</verse><verse>That thou mayest regard discretion, and <supplied>that</supplied> thy lips may keep knowledge.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For the lips of a strange woman drop <supplied>as</supplied> an honeycomb, and her mouth <supplied>is</supplied> smoother than oil:
</verse><verse>But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
</verse><verse>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
</verse><verse>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <supplied>that</supplied> thou canst not know <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
</verse><verse>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
</verse><verse>Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
</verse><verse>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <supplied>be</supplied> in the house of a stranger;
</verse><verse>And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
</verse><verse>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
</verse><verse>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
</verse><verse>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
</verse><verse>Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <supplied>and</supplied> rivers of waters in the streets.
</verse><verse>Let them be only thine own, and not strangersâ€™ with thee.
</verse><verse>Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
</verse><verse><supplied>Let her be as</supplied> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
</verse><verse>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
</verse><verse>For the ways of man <supplied>are</supplied> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
</verse><verse>He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
     
      </verse>
