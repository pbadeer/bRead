      <verse>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
</verse><verse>She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
</verse><verse>She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
</verse><verse>Whoso <supplied>is</supplied> simple, let him turn in hither: <supplied>as for</supplied> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
</verse><verse>Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine <supplied>which</supplied> I have mingled.
</verse><verse>Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
</verse><verse>He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <supplied>man getteth</supplied> himself a blot.
</verse><verse>Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
</verse><verse>Give <supplied>instruction</supplied> to a wise <supplied>man,</supplied> and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <supplied>man,</supplied> and he will increase in learning.
</verse><verse>The fear of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <supplied>is</supplied> understanding.
</verse><verse>For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
</verse><verse>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <supplied>if</supplied> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <supplied>it.</supplied>

      <verse>A foolish woman <supplied>is</supplied> clamorous: <supplied>she is</supplied> simple, and knoweth nothing.
</verse><verse>For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
</verse><verse>To call passengers who go right on their ways:
</verse><verse>Whoso <supplied>is</supplied> simple, let him turn in hither: and <supplied>as for</supplied> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
</verse><verse>Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <supplied>eaten</supplied> in secret is pleasant.
</verse><verse>But he knoweth not that the dead <supplied>are</supplied> there; <supplied>and that</supplied> her guests <supplied>are</supplied> in the depths of hell.
