      <verse>As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
</verse><verse>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
</verse><verse>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool&#x2019;s back.
</verse><verse>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
</verse><verse>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
</verse><verse>He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <supplied>and</supplied> drinketh damage.
</verse><verse>The legs of the lame are not equal: so <supplied>is</supplied> a parable in the mouth of fools.
</verse><verse>As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <supplied>is</supplied> he that giveth honour to a fool.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <supplied>is</supplied> a parable in the mouth of fools.
</verse><verse>The great <supplied>God</supplied> that formed all <supplied>things</supplied> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
</verse><verse>As a dog returneth to his vomit, <supplied>so</supplied> a fool returneth to his folly.
</verse><verse>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <supplied>there is</supplied> more hope of a fool than of him.
</verse><verse>The slothful <supplied>man</supplied> saith, <supplied>There is</supplied> a lion in the way; a lion <supplied>is</supplied> in the streets.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <supplied>doth</supplied> the slothful upon his bed.
</verse><verse>The slothful hideth his hand in <supplied>his</supplied> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
</verse><verse>The sluggard <supplied>is</supplied> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
</verse><verse>He that passeth by, <supplied>and</supplied> meddleth with strife <supplied>belonging</supplied> not to him, <supplied>is like</supplied> one that taketh a dog by the ears.
</verse><verse>As a mad <supplied>man</supplied> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
</verse><verse>So <supplied>is</supplied> the man <supplied>that</supplied> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
</verse><verse>Where no wood is, <supplied>there</supplied> the fire goeth out: so where <supplied>there is</supplied> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> coals <supplied>are</supplied> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <supplied>is</supplied> a contentious man to kindle strife.
</verse><verse>The words of a talebearer <supplied>are</supplied> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
</verse><verse>Burning lips and a wicked heart <supplied>are like</supplied> a potsherd covered with silver dross.
</verse><verse>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;
</verse><verse>When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <supplied>there are</supplied> seven abominations in his heart.
</verse><verse><supplied>Whose</supplied> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the <supplied>whole</supplied> congregation.
</verse><verse>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
</verse><verse>A lying tongue hateth <supplied>those that are</supplied> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
