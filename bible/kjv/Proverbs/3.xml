      <verse>My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
</verse><verse>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
</verse><verse>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
</verse><verse>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
</verse><verse>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
</verse><verse>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
</verse><verse>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
</verse><verse>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
</verse><verse>For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <supplied>in whom</supplied> he delighteth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Happy <supplied>is</supplied> the man <supplied>that</supplied> findeth wisdom, and the man <supplied>that</supplied> getteth understanding.
</verse><verse>For the merchandise of it <supplied>is</supplied> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
</verse><verse>She <supplied>is</supplied> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
</verse><verse>Length of days <supplied>is</supplied> in her right hand; <supplied>and</supplied> in her left hand riches and honour.
</verse><verse>Her ways <supplied>are</supplied> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <supplied>are</supplied> peace.
</verse><verse>She <supplied>is</supplied> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <supplied>is every one</supplied> that retaineth her.
</verse><verse>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
</verse><verse>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
</verse><verse>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
</verse><verse>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
</verse><verse>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
</verse><verse>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
</verse><verse>For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
</verse><verse>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
</verse><verse>For the froward <supplied>is</supplied> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <supplied>is</supplied> with the righteous.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The curse of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
</verse><verse>Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
</verse><verse>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
     
      </verse>
