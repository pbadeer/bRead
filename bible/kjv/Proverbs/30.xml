      <verse>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <supplied>even</supplied> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
</verse><verse>Surely I <supplied>am</supplied> more brutish than <supplied>any</supplied> man, and have not the understanding of a man.
</verse><verse>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
</verse><verse>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <supplied>is</supplied> his name, and what <supplied>is</supplied> his son’s name, if
thou canst tell?
</verse><verse>Every word of God <supplied>is</supplied> pure: he <supplied>is</supplied> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
</verse><verse>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
</verse><verse>Two <supplied>things</supplied> have I required of thee; deny me <supplied>them</supplied> not before I die:
</verse><verse>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
</verse><verse>Lest I be full, and deny <supplied>thee,</supplied> and say, Who <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <supplied>in vain. </supplied></verse><verse>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a generation <supplied>that</supplied> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a generation <supplied>that are</supplied> pure in their own eyes, and <supplied>yet</supplied> is not washed from their filthiness.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a generation, whose teeth <supplied>are as</supplied> swords, and their jaw teeth <supplied>as</supplied> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <supplied>among</supplied> men.
</verse><verse>The horseleach hath two daughters, <supplied>crying,</supplied> Give, give. There are three <supplied>things that are</supplied> never satisfied, <supplied>yea,</supplied> four <supplied>things</supplied> say not, <supplied>It is</supplied> enough:
</verse><verse>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <supplied>that</supplied> is not filled with water; and the fire <supplied>that</supplied> saith not, <supplied>It is</supplied> enough.
</verse><verse>The eye <supplied>that</supplied> mocketh at <supplied>his</supplied> father, and despiseth to obey <supplied>his</supplied> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
</verse><verse>There be three <supplied>things which</supplied> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
</verse><verse>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
</verse><verse>Such <supplied>is</supplied> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
</verse><verse>For three <supplied>things</supplied> the earth is disquieted, and for four <supplied>which</supplied> it cannot bear:
</verse><verse>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
</verse><verse>For an odious <supplied>woman</supplied> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
</verse><verse>There be four <supplied>things which are</supplied> little upon the earth, but they <supplied>are</supplied> exceeding wise:
</verse><verse>The ants <supplied>are</supplied> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
</verse><verse>The conies <supplied>are but</supplied> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
</verse><verse>The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
</verse><verse>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.
</verse><verse>There be three <supplied>things</supplied> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
</verse><verse>A lion <supplied>which is</supplied> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
</verse><verse>A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <supplied>there is</supplied> no rising up.
</verse><verse>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <supplied>lay</supplied> thine hand upon thy mouth.
</verse><verse>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
