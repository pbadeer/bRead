      <verse>Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
</verse><verse>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
</verse><verse>A stone <supplied>is</supplied> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool&#x2019;s wrath <supplied>is</supplied> heavier than them both.
</verse><verse>Wrath <supplied>is</supplied> cruel, and anger <supplied>is</supplied> outrageous; but who <supplied>is</supplied> able to stand before envy?
</verse><verse>Open rebuke <supplied>is</supplied> better than secret love.
</verse><verse>Faithful <supplied>are</supplied> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy <supplied>are</supplied> deceitful.
</verse><verse>The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
</verse><verse>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <supplied>is</supplied> a man that wandereth from his place.
</verse><verse>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <supplied>doth</supplied> the sweetness of a man&#x2019;s friend by hearty counsel.
</verse><verse>Thine own friend, and thy father&#x2019;s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother&#x2019;s house in the day of thy calamity: <supplied>for</supplied> better <supplied>is</supplied> a neighbour <supplied>that is</supplied> near than a brother far off.
</verse><verse>My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
</verse><verse>A prudent <supplied>man</supplied> foreseeth the evil, <supplied>and</supplied> hideth himself; <supplied>but</supplied> the simple pass on, <supplied>and</supplied> are punished.
</verse><verse>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
</verse><verse>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
</verse><verse>A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
</verse><verse>Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <supplied>which</supplied> bewrayeth <supplied>itself. </supplied></verse><verse>Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
</verse><verse>Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
</verse><verse>As in water face <supplied>answereth</supplied> to face, so the heart of man to man.
</verse><verse>Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <supplied>is</supplied> a man to his praise.
</verse><verse>Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <supplied>yet</supplied> will not his foolishness depart from him.
</verse><verse>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <supplied>and</supplied> look well to thy herds.
</verse><verse>For riches <supplied>are</supplied> not for ever: and doth the crown <supplied>endure</supplied> to every generation?
</verse><verse>The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
</verse><verse>The lambs <supplied>are</supplied> for thy clothing, and the goats <supplied>are</supplied> the price of the field.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>thou shalt have</supplied> goats&#x2019; milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and <supplied>for</supplied> the maintenance for thy maidens.
