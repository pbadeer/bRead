      <verse>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried <supplied>him</supplied> away, and delivered <supplied>him</supplied> to Pilate.
</verse><verse>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <jesus>Thou sayest <supplied>it. </supplied></jesus></verse><verse>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
</verse><verse>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
</verse><verse>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
</verse><verse>Now at <supplied>that</supplied> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
</verse><verse>And there was <supplied>one</supplied> named Barabbas, <supplied>which lay</supplied> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
</verse><verse>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <supplied>him to do</supplied> as he had ever done unto them.
</verse><verse>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
</verse><verse>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
</verse><verse>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
</verse><verse>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <supplied>unto him</supplied> whom ye call the King of the Jews?
</verse><verse>And they cried out again, Crucify him.
</verse><verse>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And <supplied>so</supplied> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <supplied>him,</supplied> to be crucified.
</verse><verse>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
</verse><verse>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <supplied>head, </supplied></verse><verse>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
</verse><verse>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <supplied>their</supplied> knees worshipped him.
</verse><verse>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
</verse><verse>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
</verse><verse>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
</verse><verse>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <supplied>it</supplied> not.
</verse><verse>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
</verse><verse>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
</verse><verse>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
</verse><verse>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
</verse><verse>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
</verse><verse>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <supplied>it</supplied> in three days,
</verse><verse>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
</verse><verse>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
</verse><verse>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
</verse><verse>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
</verse><verse>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <jesus>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</jesus> which is, being interpreted, <jesus>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </jesus></verse><verse>And some of them that stood by, when they heard
<supplied>it,</supplied> said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
</verse><verse>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <supplied>it</supplied> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
</verse><verse>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
</verse><verse>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
</verse><verse>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
</verse><verse>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
</verse><verse>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
</verse><verse>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <supplied>unto him</supplied> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
</verse><verse>And when he knew <supplied>it</supplied> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
</verse><verse>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
</verse><verse>And Mary Magdalene and Mary <supplied>the mother</supplied> of Joses beheld where he was laid.
