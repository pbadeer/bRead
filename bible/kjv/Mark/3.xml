      <verse>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
</verse><verse>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
</verse><verse>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, <jesus>Stand forth. </jesus></verse><verse>And he saith unto them, <jesus>Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?</jesus> But they held their peace.
</verse><verse>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, <jesus>Stretch forth thine hand.</jesus> And he stretched <supplied>it</supplied> out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
</verse><verse>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
</verse><verse>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
</verse><verse>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and <supplied>from</supplied> beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
</verse><verse>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
</verse><verse>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
</verse><verse>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
</verse><verse>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
</verse><verse>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth <supplied>unto him</supplied> whom he would: and they came unto him.
</verse><verse>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
</verse><verse>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
</verse><verse>And Simon he surnamed Peter;
</verse><verse>And James the <supplied>son</supplied> of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
</verse><verse>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the <supplied>son</supplied> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
</verse><verse>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
</verse><verse>And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
</verse><verse>And when his friends heard <supplied>of it,</supplied> they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
</verse><verse>And he called them <supplied>unto him,</supplied> and said unto them in parables, <jesus>How can Satan cast out Satan? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if a house be divided against itself,
that house cannot stand. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>No man can enter into a strong man&#x2019;s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man;
and then he will spoil his house. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath
never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: </jesus></verse><verse>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
</verse><verse>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
</verse><verse>And he answered them, saying, <jesus>Who is my mother, or my brethren? </jesus></verse><verse>And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, <jesus>Behold my mother and my brethren! </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same
is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
