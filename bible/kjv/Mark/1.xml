      <verse>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
</verse><verse>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
</verse><verse>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
</verse><verse>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
</verse><verse>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
</verse><verse>And John was clothed with camel&#x2019;s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
</verse><verse>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
</verse><verse>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
</verse><verse>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
</verse><verse>And there came a voice from heaven, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</verse><verse>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
</verse><verse>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
</verse><verse>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
</verse><verse>And saying, <jesus>The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. </jesus></verse><verse>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
fishers.
</verse><verse>And Jesus said unto them, <jesus>Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. </jesus></verse><verse>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
</verse><verse>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the <supplied>son</supplied> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
</verse><verse>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
</verse><verse>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
</verse><verse>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
</verse><verse>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
</verse><verse>Saying, Let <supplied>us</supplied> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
</verse><verse>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <jesus>Hold thy peace, and come out of him. </jesus></verse><verse>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
</verse><verse>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <supplied>is</supplied> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
</verse><verse>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
</verse><verse>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
</verse><verse>But Simon&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
</verse><verse>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
</verse><verse>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
</verse><verse>And all the city was gathered together at the door.
</verse><verse>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
</verse><verse>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
</verse><verse>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
</verse><verse>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <supplied>men</supplied> seek for thee.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. </jesus></verse><verse>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
</verse><verse>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</verse><verse>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <supplied>his</supplied> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <jesus>I will; be thou clean. </jesus></verse><verse>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
</verse><verse>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
</verse><verse>And saith unto him, <jesus>See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. </jesus></verse><verse>But he went out, and began to publish
<supplied>it</supplied> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
