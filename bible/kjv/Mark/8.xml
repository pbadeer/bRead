      <verse>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples <supplied>unto him,</supplied> and saith unto them,
</verse><verse><jesus>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
</jesus></verse><verse>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these <supplied>men</supplied> with bread here in the wilderness?
</verse><verse>And he asked them, <jesus>How many loaves have ye?</jesus> And they said, Seven.
</verse><verse>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <supplied>them;</supplied> and they did set <supplied>them</supplied> before the people.
</verse><verse>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <supplied>meat</supplied> that was left seven baskets.
</verse><verse>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
</verse><verse>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
</verse><verse>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
</verse><verse>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, <jesus>Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. </jesus></verse><verse>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
the other side.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now <supplied>the disciples</supplied> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
</verse><verse>And he charged them, saying, <jesus>Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <supplied>of</supplied> the leaven of Herod. </jesus></verse><verse>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <supplied>It is</supplied> because we have no bread.
</verse><verse>And when Jesus knew <supplied>it,</supplied> he saith unto them, <jesus>Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and
do ye not remember? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</jesus> They say unto him, Twelve.
</verse><verse><jesus>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</jesus> And they said, Seven.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>How is it that ye do not understand?
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
</verse><verse>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
</verse><verse>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
</verse><verse>After that he put <supplied>his</supplied> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
</verse><verse>And he sent him away to his house, saying, <jesus>Neither go into the town, nor tell <supplied>it</supplied> to any in the town.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, <jesus>Whom do men say that I am? </jesus></verse><verse>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <supplied>say,</supplied> Elias;
and others, One of the prophets.
</verse><verse>And he saith unto them, <jesus>But whom say ye that I am?</jesus> And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
</verse><verse>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
</verse><verse>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <supplied>of</supplied> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
</verse><verse>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
</verse><verse>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, <jesus>Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And when he had called the people <supplied>unto him</supplied> with his disciples also, he said unto them, <jesus>Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel&#x2019;s, the same shall save it. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Or what shall a man give in
exchange for his soul? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
     
      </jesus>
