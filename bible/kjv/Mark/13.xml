      <verse>And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings <supplied>are here! </supplied></verse><verse>And Jesus answering said unto him, <jesus>Seest thou these great buildings? there shall
not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. </jesus></verse><verse>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
</verse><verse>Tell us, when shall these things be? and what <supplied>shall be</supplied> the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
</verse><verse>And Jesus answering them began to say, <jesus>Take heed lest any <supplied>man</supplied> deceive you: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am <supplied>Christ;</supplied> and shall deceive many. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of
wars, be ye not troubled: for <supplied>such things</supplied> must needs be; but the end <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> yet. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there
shall be famines and troubles: these <supplied>are</supplied> the beginnings of sorrows.

      <verse>
      <jesus>But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the gospel
must first be published among all nations. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when they shall lead <supplied>you,</supplied> and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak
ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against <supplied>their</supplied> parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye shall be hated of all <supplied>men</supplied> for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not,</jesus> (let him that readeth understand,) <jesus>then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And let
him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter <supplied>therein,</supplied> to take any thing out of his house: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But woe to them
that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For <supplied>in</supplied> those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God
created unto this time, neither shall be. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And then if any man shall
say to you, Lo, here <supplied>is</supplied> Christ; or, lo, <supplied>he is</supplied> there; believe <supplied>him</supplied> not: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if <supplied>it were</supplied> possible, even the elect.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And then
shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of
heaven. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh,
<supplied>even</supplied> at the doors. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>But of that day and <supplied>that</supplied> hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus><supplied>For the Son
of man is</supplied> as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh,
at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
