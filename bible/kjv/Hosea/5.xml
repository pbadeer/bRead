<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Hosea" n="5" book-chapters="14">
      <verse>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <supplied>is</supplied> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
</verse><verse>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <supplied>have been</supplied> a rebuker of them all.
</verse><verse>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <supplied>and</supplied> Israel is defiled.
</verse><verse>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
</verse><verse>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find <supplied>him;</supplied> he hath withdrawn himself from them.
</verse><verse>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
</verse><verse>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <supplied>and</supplied> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <supplied>at</supplied> Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
</verse><verse>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
</verse><verse>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <supplied>therefore</supplied> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
</verse><verse>Ephraim <supplied>is</supplied> oppressed <supplied>and</supplied> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
</verse><verse>Therefore <supplied>will</supplied> I <supplied>be</supplied> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
</verse><verse>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <supplied>saw</supplied> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
</verse><verse>For I will <supplied>be</supplied> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <supplied>even</supplied> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <supplied>him.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I will go <supplied>and</supplied> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
