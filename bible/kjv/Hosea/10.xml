      <verse>Israel <supplied>is</supplied> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
</verse><verse>Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
</verse><verse>For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?
</verse><verse>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
</verse><verse>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <supplied>that</supplied> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
</verse><verse>It shall be also carried unto Assyria <supplied>for</supplied> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
</verse><verse><supplied>As for</supplied> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
</verse><verse>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
</verse><verse>O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
</verse><verse>And Ephraim <supplied>is as</supplied> an heifer <supplied>that is</supplied> taught, <supplied>and</supplied> loveth to tread out <supplied>the corn;</supplied> but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <supplied>and</supplied> Jacob shall break his clods.
</verse><verse>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <supplied>it is</supplied> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
</verse><verse>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth- arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <supplied>her</supplied> children.
</verse><verse>So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
