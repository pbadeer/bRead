      <verse>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <supplied>is</supplied> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
</verse><verse>Therefore have I hewed <supplied>them</supplied> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <supplied>are as</supplied> the light <supplied>that</supplied> goeth forth.
</verse><verse>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
