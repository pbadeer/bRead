      <verse>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as <supplied>other</supplied> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
</verse><verse>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
</verse><verse>They shall not dwell in the LORD&#x2019;S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <supplied>things</supplied> in Assyria.
</verse><verse>They shall not offer wine <supplied>offerings</supplied> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <supplied>shall be</supplied> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall
not come into the house of the LORD.
</verse><verse>What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
</verse><verse>For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant <supplied>places</supplied> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns <supplied>shall be</supplied> in their tabernacles.
</verse><verse>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <supplied>it:</supplied> the prophet <supplied>is</supplied> a fool, the spiritual man <supplied>is</supplied> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.
</verse><verse>The watchman of Ephraim <supplied>was</supplied> with my God: <supplied>but</supplied> the prophet <supplied>is</supplied> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <supplied>and</supplied> hatred in the house of his God.
</verse><verse>They have deeply corrupted <supplied>themselves,</supplied> as in the days of Gibeah: <supplied>therefore</supplied> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
</verse><verse>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: <supplied>but</supplied> they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto <supplied>that</supplied> shame; and <supplied>their</supplied> abominations were
according as they loved.
</verse><verse><supplied>As for</supplied> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
</verse><verse>Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, <supplied>that there shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> a man <supplied>left:</supplied> yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
</verse><verse>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, <supplied>is</supplied> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
</verse><verse>Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
</verse><verse>All their wickedness <supplied>is</supplied> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes <supplied>are</supplied> revolters.
</verse><verse>Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay <supplied>even</supplied> the beloved <supplied>fruit</supplied> of their womb.
</verse><verse>My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
