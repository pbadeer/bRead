</verse><verse>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, <supplied>departing</supplied> from the LORD.
</verse><verse>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <supplied>while,</supplied> and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
