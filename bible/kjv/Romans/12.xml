      <verse>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <supplied>which is</supplied> your reasonable service.
</verse><verse>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <supplied>of himself</supplied> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
</verse><verse>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
</verse><verse>So we, <supplied>being</supplied> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
</verse><verse>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <supplied>let us prophesy</supplied> according to the proportion of faith;
</verse><verse>Or ministry, <supplied>let us wait</supplied> on <supplied>our</supplied> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
</verse><verse>Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <supplied>let him do it</supplied> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>Let</supplied> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
</verse><verse><supplied>Be</supplied> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
</verse><verse>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
</verse><verse>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
</verse><verse>Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
</verse><verse>Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
</verse><verse>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
</verse><verse><supplied>Be</supplied> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
</verse><verse>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
</verse><verse>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
</verse><verse>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <supplied>rather</supplied> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <supplied>is</supplied> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
</verse><verse>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
</verse><verse>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
