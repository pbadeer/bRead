      <verse>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
</verse><verse>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
</verse><verse>And not only <supplied>so,</supplied> but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
</verse><verse>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
</verse><verse>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
</verse><verse>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
</verse><verse>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
</verse><verse>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
</verse><verse>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
</verse><verse>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
</verse><verse>And not only <supplied>so,</supplied> but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
</verse><verse>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam&#x2019;s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
</verse><verse>But not as the offence, so also <supplied>is</supplied> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <supplied>which is</supplied> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
</verse><verse>And not as <supplied>it was</supplied> by one that sinned, <supplied>so is</supplied> the gift: for the judgment <supplied>was</supplied> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <supplied>is</supplied> of many offences unto justification.
</verse><verse>For if by one man&#x2019;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
</verse><verse>Therefore as by the offence of one <supplied>judgment came</supplied> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <supplied>the free gift came</supplied> upon all men unto justification of life.
</verse><verse>For as by one man&#x2019;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
</verse><verse>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
</verse><verse>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
