      <verse>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
</verse><verse>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <supplied>whereof</supplied> to glory; but not before God.
</verse><verse>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
</verse><verse>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
</verse><verse>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
</verse><verse>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
</verse><verse><supplied>Saying,</supplied> Blessed <supplied>are</supplied> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
</verse><verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
</verse><verse><supplied>Cometh</supplied> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <supplied>only,</supplied> or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
</verse><verse>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
</verse><verse>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <supplied>he had yet</supplied> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also:
</verse><verse>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <supplied>he had</supplied> being <supplied>yet</supplied> uncircumcised.
</verse><verse>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <supplied>was</supplied> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
</verse><verse>For if they which are of the law <supplied>be</supplied> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
</verse><verse>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <supplied>there is</supplied> no transgression.
</verse><verse>Therefore <supplied>it is</supplied> of faith, that <supplied>it might be</supplied> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
</verse><verse>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <supplied>even</supplied> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
</verse><verse>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
</verse><verse>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah&#x2019;s womb:
</verse><verse>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
</verse><verse>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
</verse><verse>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
</verse><verse>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
</verse><verse>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
</verse><verse>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
