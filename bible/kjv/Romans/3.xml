      <verse>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <supplied>is there</supplied> of circumcision?
</verse><verse>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
</verse><verse>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
</verse><verse>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
</verse><verse>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <supplied>Is</supplied> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
</verse><verse>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
</verse><verse>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
</verse><verse>And not <supplied>rather,</supplied> (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>What then? are we better <supplied>than they?</supplied> No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
</verse><verse>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
</verse><verse>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
</verse><verse>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
</verse><verse>Their throat <supplied>is</supplied> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <supplied>is</supplied> under their lips:
</verse><verse>Whose mouth <supplied>is</supplied> full of cursing and bitterness:
</verse><verse>Their feet <supplied>are</supplied> swift to shed blood:
</verse><verse>Destruction and misery <supplied>are</supplied> in their ways:
</verse><verse>And the way of peace have they not known:
</verse><verse>There is no fear of God before their eyes.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
</verse><verse>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <supplied>is</supplied> the knowledge of sin.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
</verse><verse>Even the righteousness of God <supplied>which is</supplied> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
</verse><verse>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
</verse><verse>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
</verse><verse>Whom God hath set forth <supplied>to be</supplied> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
</verse><verse>To declare, <supplied>I say,</supplied> at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
</verse><verse>Where <supplied>is</supplied> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
</verse><verse>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
</verse><verse><supplied>Is he</supplied> the God of the Jews only? <supplied>is he</supplied> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
</verse><verse>Seeing <supplied>it is</supplied> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
</verse><verse>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
     
      </verse>
