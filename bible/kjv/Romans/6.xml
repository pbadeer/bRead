      <verse>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
</verse><verse>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
</verse><verse>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
</verse><verse>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
</verse><verse>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <supplied>in the likeness of his</supplied> resurrection:
</verse><verse>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <supplied>him,</supplied> that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
</verse><verse>For he that is dead is freed from sin.
</verse><verse>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
</verse><verse>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
</verse><verse>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
</verse><verse>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
</verse><verse>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
</verse><verse>Neither yield ye your members <supplied>as</supplied> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <supplied>as</supplied> instruments of righteousness unto God.
</verse><verse>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
</verse><verse>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
</verse><verse>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
</verse><verse>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
</verse><verse>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
</verse><verse>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
</verse><verse>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
</verse><verse>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <supplied>is</supplied> death.
</verse><verse>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
</verse><verse>For the wages of sin <supplied>is</supplied> death; but the gift of God <supplied>is</supplied> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
