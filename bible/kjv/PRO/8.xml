      <verse>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
</verse><verse>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
</verse><verse>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
</verse><verse>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <supplied>is</supplied> to the sons of man.
</verse><verse>O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
</verse><verse>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <supplied>shall be</supplied> right things.
</verse><verse>For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <supplied>is</supplied> an abomination to my lips.
</verse><verse>All the words of my mouth <supplied>are</supplied> in righteousness; <supplied>there is</supplied> nothing froward or perverse in them.
</verse><verse>They <supplied>are</supplied> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
</verse><verse>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
</verse><verse>For wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
</verse><verse>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
</verse><verse>The fear of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
</verse><verse>Counsel <supplied>is</supplied> mine, and sound wisdom: I <supplied>am</supplied> understanding; I have strength.
</verse><verse>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
</verse><verse>By me princes rule, and nobles, <supplied>even</supplied> all the judges of the earth.
</verse><verse>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
</verse><verse>Riches and honour <supplied>are</supplied> with me; <supplied>yea,</supplied> durable riches and righteousness.
</verse><verse>My fruit <supplied>is</supplied> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
</verse><verse>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
</verse><verse>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
</verse><verse>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
</verse><verse>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
</verse><verse>When <supplied>there were</supplied> no depths, I was brought forth; when <supplied>there were</supplied> no fountains abounding with water.
</verse><verse>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
</verse><verse>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
</verse><verse>When he prepared the heavens, I <supplied>was</supplied> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
</verse><verse>When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
</verse><verse>When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
</verse><verse>Then I was by him, <supplied>as</supplied> one brought up <supplied>with him:</supplied> and I was daily <supplied>his</supplied> delight, rejoicing always before him;
</verse><verse>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <supplied>were</supplied> with the sons of men.
</verse><verse>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <supplied>are they that</supplied> keep my ways.
</verse><verse>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
</verse><verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
</verse><verse>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
</verse><verse>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
