<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="PRO" n="7">
      <verse>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
</verse><verse>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
</verse><verse>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
</verse><verse>Say unto wisdom, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my sister; and call understanding <supplied>thy</supplied> kinswoman:
</verse><verse>That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <supplied>which</supplied> flattereth with her words.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
</verse><verse>And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
</verse><verse>Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
</verse><verse>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
</verse><verse>And, behold, there met him a woman <supplied>with</supplied> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
</verse><verse>(She <supplied>is</supplied> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
</verse><verse>Now <supplied>is she</supplied> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
</verse><verse>So she caught him, and kissed him, <supplied>and</supplied> with an impudent face said unto him,
</verse><verse><supplied>I have</supplied> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
</verse><verse>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
</verse><verse>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <supplied>works,</supplied> with fine linen of Egypt.
</verse><verse>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
</verse><verse>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
</verse><verse>For the goodman <supplied>is</supplied> not at home, he is gone a long journey:
</verse><verse>He hath taken a bag of money with him, <supplied>and</supplied> will come home at the day appointed.
</verse><verse>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
</verse><verse>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
</verse><verse>Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <supplied>is</supplied> for his life.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
</verse><verse>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
</verse><verse>For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <supplied>men</supplied> have been slain by her.
</verse><verse>Her house <supplied>is</supplied> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
