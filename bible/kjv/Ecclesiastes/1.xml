      <verse>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
</verse><verse><supplied>One</supplied> generation passeth away, and <supplied>another</supplied> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
</verse><verse>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
</verse><verse>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
</verse><verse>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <supplied>is</supplied> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
</verse><verse>All things <supplied>are</supplied> full of labour; man cannot utter <supplied>it:</supplied> the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
</verse><verse>The thing that hath been, it <supplied>is that</supplied> which shall be; and that which is done <supplied>is</supplied> that which shall be done: and <supplied>there is</supplied> no new <supplied>thing</supplied> under the sun.
</verse><verse>Is there <supplied>any</supplied> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <supplied>is</supplied> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> no remembrance of former <supplied>things;</supplied> neither shall there be <supplied>any</supplied> remembrance of <supplied>things</supplied> that are to come with <supplied>those</supplied> that shall come after.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <supplied>things</supplied> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
</verse><verse>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <supplied>is</supplied> vanity and vexation of spirit.
</verse><verse><supplied>That which is</supplied> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
</verse><verse>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <supplied>they</supplied> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
</verse><verse>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
</verse><verse>For in much wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
