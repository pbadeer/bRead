      <verse>To every <supplied>thing there is</supplied> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
</verse><verse>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <supplied>that which is</supplied> planted;
</verse><verse>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
</verse><verse>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
</verse><verse>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
</verse><verse>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
</verse><verse>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
</verse><verse>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
</verse><verse>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
</verse><verse>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
</verse><verse>He hath made every <supplied>thing</supplied> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
</verse><verse>I know that <supplied>there is</supplied> no good in them, but for <supplied>a man</supplied> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
</verse><verse>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <supplied>is</supplied> the gift of God.
</verse><verse>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <supplied>it,</supplied> that <supplied>men</supplied> should fear before him.
</verse><verse>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.

      <verse>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <supplied>that</supplied> wickedness <supplied>was</supplied> there; and the place of righteousness, <supplied>that</supplied> iniquity <supplied>was</supplied> there.
</verse><verse>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <supplied>there is</supplied> a time there for every purpose and for every work.
</verse><verse>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
</verse><verse>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
</verse><verse>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
</verse><verse>Wherefore I perceive that <supplied>there is</supplied> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <supplied>is</supplied> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
