      <verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> as the wise <supplied>man?</supplied> and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man&#x2019;s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>counsel thee</supplied> to keep the king&#x2019;s commandment, and <supplied>that</supplied> in regard of the oath of God.
</verse><verse>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
</verse><verse>Where the word of a king <supplied>is, there is</supplied> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
</verse><verse>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man&#x2019;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <supplied>is</supplied> great upon him.
</verse><verse>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <supplied>hath he</supplied> power in the day of death: and <supplied>there is</supplied> no discharge in <supplied>that</supplied> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
</verse><verse>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <supplied>there is</supplied> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
</verse><verse>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this <supplied>is</supplied> also vanity.
</verse><verse>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <supplied>days</supplied> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
</verse><verse>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <supplied>his</supplied> days, <supplied>which are</supplied> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
</verse><verse>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <supplied>men,</supplied> unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <supplied>men,</supplied> to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said
that this also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <supplied>there is that</supplied> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
</verse><verse>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <supplied>it</supplied> out, yet he shall not find <supplied>it;</supplied> yea further; though a wise <supplied>man</supplied> think to know
<supplied>it,</supplied> yet shall he not be able to find <supplied>it.</supplied>
