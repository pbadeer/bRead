      <verse>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <supplied>such as were</supplied> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <supplied>there was</supplied> power; but they had no
comforter.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
</verse><verse>Yea, better <supplied>is he</supplied> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <supplied>is</supplied> also vanity and vexation of spirit.
</verse><verse>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
</verse><verse>Better <supplied>is</supplied> an handful <supplied>with</supplied> quietness, than both the hands full <supplied>with</supplied> travail and vexation of spirit.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
</verse><verse>There is one <supplied>alone,</supplied> and <supplied>there is</supplied> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <supplied>is there</supplied> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <supplied>saith he,</supplied> For whom do I labour, and
bereave my soul of good? This <supplied>is</supplied> also vanity, yea, it <supplied>is</supplied> a sore travail.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Two <supplied>are</supplied> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
</verse><verse>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <supplied>that is</supplied> alone when he falleth; for <supplied>he hath</supplied> not another to help him up.
</verse><verse>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <supplied>alone? </supplied></verse><verse>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Better <supplied>is</supplied> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
</verse><verse>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <supplied>he that is</supplied> born in his kingdom becometh poor.
</verse><verse>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> no end of all the people, <supplied>even</supplied> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity and vexation of spirit.
