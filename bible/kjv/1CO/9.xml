      <verse>Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
</verse><verse>If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
</verse><verse>Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
</verse><verse>Have we not power to eat and to drink?
</verse><verse>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <supplied>as</supplied> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
</verse><verse>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
</verse><verse>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
</verse><verse>Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
</verse><verse>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
</verse><verse>Or saith he <supplied>it</supplied> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <supplied>this</supplied> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
</verse><verse>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <supplied>is it</supplied> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
</verse><verse>If others be partakers of <supplied>this</supplied> power over you, <supplied>are</supplied> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
</verse><verse>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <supplied>of the things</supplied> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
</verse><verse>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
</verse><verse>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <supplied>it were</supplied> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
</verse><verse>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
</verse><verse>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <supplied>of the gospel</supplied> is committed unto me.
</verse><verse>What is my reward then? <supplied>Verily</supplied> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
</verse><verse>For though I be free from all <supplied>men,</supplied> yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
</verse><verse>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
</verse><verse>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
</verse><verse>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <supplied>men,</supplied> that I might by all means save some.
</verse><verse>And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <supplied>you. </supplied></verse><verse>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
</verse><verse>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <supplied>do it</supplied> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
</verse><verse>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
</verse><verse>But I keep under my body, and bring <supplied>it</supplied> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
