      <verse>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, <supplied>it was</supplied> the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <supplied>is</supplied> small.
</verse><verse>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
</verse><verse>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <supplied>is</supplied> small.
</verse><verse>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <supplied>made</supplied> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
</verse><verse>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
</verse><verse>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
</verse><verse>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
</verse><verse>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <supplied>is</supplied> the king’s chapel, and it <supplied>is</supplied> the king’s court.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <supplied>was</supplied> no prophet, neither <supplied>was</supplied> I a prophet’s son; but I <supplied>was</supplied> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
</verse><verse>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <supplied>thy word</supplied> against the house of Isaac.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into
captivity forth of his land.
