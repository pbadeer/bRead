      <verse>Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
</verse><verse>Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
