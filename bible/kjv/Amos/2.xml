      <verse>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away <supplied>the punishment</supplied> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err,

      <verse>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away <supplied>the punishment</supplied> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
</verse><verse>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <supplied>same</supplied> maid, to profane my holy name:

      <verse>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height <supplied>was</supplied> like the height of the cedars, and he <supplied>was</supplied> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
</verse><verse>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
</verse><verse>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. <supplied>Is it</supplied> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.

</verse><verse>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and <supplied>he that is</supplied> swift of foot shall not deliver <supplied>himself:</supplied> neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>he that is</supplied> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.
