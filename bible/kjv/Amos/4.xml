      <verse>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that <supplied>are</supplied> in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
</verse><verse>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
</verse><verse>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <supplied>cow at that which is</supplied> before her; and ye shall cast <supplied>them</supplied> into the palace, saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, <supplied>and</supplied> your tithes after three years:
</verse><verse>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim <supplied>and</supplied> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when <supplied>there were</supplied> yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it
rained not withered.
</verse><verse>So two <supplied>or</supplied> three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured <supplied>them:</supplied> yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto
me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>I have overthrown <supplied>some</supplied> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: <supplied>and</supplied> because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
</verse><verse>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what <supplied>is</supplied> his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, <supplied>is</supplied> his
name.
