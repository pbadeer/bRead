      <verse>Woe to them <supplied>that are</supplied> at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, <supplied>which are</supplied> named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
</verse><verse>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: <supplied>be they</supplied> better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
</verse><verse>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
</verse><verse>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
</verse><verse>That chant to the sound of the viol, <supplied>and</supplied> invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
</verse><verse>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
</verse><verse>The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
</verse><verse>And a man&#x2019;s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that <supplied>is</supplied> by the sides of the house, <supplied>Is there</supplied> yet <supplied>any</supplied> with thee? and he shall say, No. Then
shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
</verse><verse>For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Shall horses run upon the rock? will <supplied>one</supplied> plow <supplied>there</supplied> with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
</verse><verse>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
</verse><verse>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.
