      <verse>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
</verse><verse>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
</verse><verse>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long <supplied>are</supplied> ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
</verse><verse>Give out from among you three men for <supplied>each</supplied> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come <supplied>again</supplied> to me.
</verse><verse>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
</verse><verse>Ye shall therefore describe the land <supplied>into</supplied> seven parts, and bring <supplied>the description</supplied> hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
</verse><verse>But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD
gave them.

      <verse>And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

      <verse>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
</verse><verse>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.

</verse><verse>And the border was drawn <supplied>thence,</supplied> and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that <supplied>lieth</supplied> before Beth- horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which <supplied>is</supplied> Kirjath- jearim, a city of
the children of Judah: this <supplied>was</supplied> the west quarter.
</verse><verse>And the south quarter <supplied>was</supplied> from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:

</verse><verse>And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:
</verse><verse>And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this <supplied>was</supplied> the south coast.
