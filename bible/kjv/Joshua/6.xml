<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Joshua" n="6">
      <verse>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, <supplied>and</supplied> the mighty men of valour.
</verse><verse>And ye shall compass the city, all <supplied>ye</supplied> men of war, <supplied>and</supplied> go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
</verse><verse>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long <supplied>blast</supplied> with the ram&#x2019;s horn, <supplied>and</supplied> when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the
people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&#x2019; horns before the ark of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#x2019; horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, <supplied>the priests</supplied> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
</verse><verse>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall <supplied>any</supplied> word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
</verse><verse>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about <supplied>it</supplied> once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&#x2019; horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, <supplied>the priests</supplied> going
on, and blowing with the trumpets.
</verse><verse>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the city shall be accursed, <supplied>even</supplied> it, and all that <supplied>are</supplied> therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that <supplied>are</supplied> with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
</verse><verse>And ye, in any wise keep <supplied>yourselves</supplied> from the accursed thing, lest ye make <supplied>yourselves</supplied> accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
</verse><verse>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, <supplied>are</supplied> consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
</verse><verse>So the people shouted when <supplied>the priests</supplied> blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up
into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
</verse><verse>And they utterly destroyed all that <supplied>was</supplied> in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
</verse><verse>But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot&#x2019;s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
</verse><verse>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
</verse><verse>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that <supplied>was</supplied> therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&#x2019;s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel <supplied>even</supplied> unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
</verse><verse>And Joshua adjured <supplied>them</supplied> at that time, saying, Cursed <supplied>be</supplied> the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest <supplied>son</supplied> shall he set
up the gates of it.
</verse><verse>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was <supplied>noised</supplied> throughout all the country.
