</verse><verse>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this <supplied>way</supplied> heretofore.
</verse><verse>And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, <supplied>that</supplied> the waters of Jordan shall be cut off <supplied>from</supplied> the waters
that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

</verse><verse>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
</verse><verse>That the waters which came down from above stood <supplied>and</supplied> rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that <supplied>is</supplied> beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, <supplied>even</supplied> the salt sea, failed, <supplied>and</supplied>
were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
</verse><verse>And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.
