</verse><verse>That the slayer that killeth <supplied>any</supplied> person unawares <supplied>and</supplied> unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
</verse><verse>And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that
