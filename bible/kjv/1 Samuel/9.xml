      <verse>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
</verse><verse>And he had a son, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <supplied>there was</supplied> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <supplied>he was</supplied> higher than any of the people.
</verse><verse>And the asses of Kish Saul&#x2019;s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
</verse><verse>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <supplied>them</supplied> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <supplied>there they were</supplied> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but
they found <supplied>them</supplied> not.
</verse><verse><supplied>And</supplied> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <supplied>was</supplied> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <supplied>caring</supplied> for the asses, and take thought for us.
</verse><verse>And he said unto him, Behold now, <supplied>there is</supplied> in this city a man of God, and <supplied>he is</supplied> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
</verse><verse>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <supplied>there is</supplied> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
</verse><verse>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <supplied>that</supplied> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
</verse><verse>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <supplied>he that is</supplied> now <supplied>called</supplied> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
</verse><verse>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God <supplied>was.</supplied>

      <verse>
      <supplied>And</supplied> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
</verse><verse>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <supplied>he is</supplied> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <supplied>there is</supplied> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
</verse><verse>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <supplied>and</supplied> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
</verse><verse>And they went up into the city: <supplied>and</supplied> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
</verse><verse>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <supplied>to be</supplied> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my
people, because their cry is come unto me.
</verse><verse>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.
</verse><verse>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer&#x2019;s house <supplied>is. </supplied></verse><verse>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <supplied>am</supplied> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that <supplied>is</supplied> in thine heart.
</verse><verse>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <supplied>is</supplied> all the desire of Israel? <supplied>Is it</supplied> not on thee, and on all thy father&#x2019;s house?
</verse><verse>And Saul answered and said, <supplied>Am</supplied> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
</verse><verse>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <supplied>were</supplied> about thirty persons.
</verse><verse>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
</verse><verse>And the cook took up the shoulder, and <supplied>that</supplied> which <supplied>was</supplied> upon it, and set <supplied>it</supplied> before Saul. And <supplied>Samuel</supplied> said, Behold that which is left! set <supplied>it</supplied> before thee, <supplied>and</supplied> eat: for unto this time hath it been
kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <supplied>Samuel</supplied> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
</verse><verse>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
</verse><verse><supplied>And</supplied> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
