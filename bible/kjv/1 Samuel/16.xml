      <verse>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
sons.
</verse><verse>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <supplied>it,</supplied> he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
</verse><verse>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <supplied>him</supplied> whom I name unto thee.
</verse><verse>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
</verse><verse>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD&#x2019;S anointed <supplied>is</supplied> before him.
</verse><verse>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <supplied>the LORD seeth</supplied> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
</verse><verse>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
</verse><verse>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
</verse><verse>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
</verse><verse>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <supplied>thy</supplied> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
</verse><verse>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <supplied>was</supplied> ruddy, <supplied>and</supplied> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <supplied>is</supplied> he.
</verse><verse>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
</verse><verse>And Saul&#x2019;s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
</verse><verse>Let our lord now command thy servants, <supplied>which are</supplied> before thee, to seek out a man, <supplied>who is</supplied> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and
thou shalt be well.
</verse><verse>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <supplied>him</supplied> to me.
</verse><verse>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <supplied>that is</supplied> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD
<supplied>is</supplied> with him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <supplied>is</supplied> with the sheep.
</verse><verse>And Jesse took an ass <supplied>laden</supplied> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <supplied>them</supplied> by David his son unto Saul.
</verse><verse>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
</verse><verse>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when the <supplied>evil</supplied> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
