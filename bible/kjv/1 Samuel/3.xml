      <verse>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <supplied>there was</supplied> no open vision.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <supplied>was</supplied> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <supplied>that</supplied> he could not see;
</verse><verse>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <supplied>was,</supplied> and Samuel was laid down <supplied>to sleep; </supplied></verse><verse>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I.
</verse><verse>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
</verse><verse>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
</verse><verse>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
</verse><verse>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
</verse><verse>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
</verse><verse>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
</verse><verse>In that day I will perform against Eli all <supplied>things</supplied> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
</verse><verse>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
</verse><verse>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli&#x2019;s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
</verse><verse>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I.
</verse><verse>And he said, What <supplied>is</supplied> the thing that <supplied>the LORD</supplied> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <supplied>it</supplied> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <supplied>any</supplied> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
</verse><verse>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
</verse><verse>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel <supplied>was</supplied> established <supplied>to be</supplied> a prophet of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
