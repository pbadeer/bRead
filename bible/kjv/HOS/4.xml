<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="HOS" n="4">
      <verse>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <supplied>there is</supplied> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
</verse><verse>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
</verse><verse>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people <supplied>are</supplied> as they that strive with the priest.
</verse><verse>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
</verse><verse>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <supplied>therefore</supplied> will I change their glory into shame.
</verse><verse>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
</verse><verse>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
</verse><verse>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
</verse><verse>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <supplied>them</supplied> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
</verse><verse>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <supplied>is</supplied> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit
adultery.
</verse><verse>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <supplied>that</supplied> doth not understand shall
fall.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <supplied>yet</supplied> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
</verse><verse>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
</verse><verse>Ephraim <supplied>is</supplied> joined to idols: let him alone.
</verse><verse>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers <supplied>with</supplied> shame do love, Give ye.
</verse><verse>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
     
      </verse>
