      <verse>
      <supplied>Set</supplied> the trumpet to thy mouth. <supplied>He shall come</supplied> as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
</verse><verse>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
</verse><verse>Israel hath cast off <supplied>the thing that is</supplied> good: the enemy shall pursue him.
</verse><verse>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <supplied>it</supplied> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <supplied>thee</supplied> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <supplied>will it be</supplied> ere they attain to innocency?
</verse><verse>For from Israel <supplied>was</supplied> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <supplied>is</supplied> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
</verse><verse>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
</verse><verse>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein <supplied>is</supplied> no pleasure.
</verse><verse>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
</verse><verse>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
</verse><verse>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
</verse><verse>I have written to him the great things of my law, <supplied>but</supplied> they were counted as a strange thing.
</verse><verse>They sacrifice flesh <supplied>for</supplied> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and <supplied>eat it;</supplied> but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.
</verse><verse>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
