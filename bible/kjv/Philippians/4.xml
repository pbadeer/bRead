      <verse>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <supplied>my</supplied> dearly beloved.
</verse><verse>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
</verse><verse>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <supplied>with</supplied> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <supplied>are</supplied> in the book of life.
</verse><verse>Rejoice in the Lord alway: <supplied>and</supplied> again I say, Rejoice.
</verse><verse>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <supplied>is</supplied> at hand.
</verse><verse>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
</verse><verse>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <supplied>are</supplied> honest, whatsoever things <supplied>are</supplied> just, whatsoever things <supplied>are</supplied> pure, whatsoever things <supplied>are</supplied> lovely, whatsoever things <supplied>are</supplied> of good report; if
<supplied>there be</supplied> any virtue, and if <supplied>there be</supplied> any praise, think on these things.
</verse><verse>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
</verse><verse>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <supplied>therewith</supplied> to be content.
</verse><verse>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
</verse><verse>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
</verse><verse>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
</verse><verse>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
</verse><verse>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
</verse><verse>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
</verse><verse>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <supplied>which were sent</supplied> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
</verse><verse>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>Now unto God and our Father <supplied>be</supplied> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
</verse><verse>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar&#x2019;s household.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with you all. Amen.
