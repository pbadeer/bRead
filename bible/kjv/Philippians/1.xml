      <verse>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
</verse><verse>Grace <supplied>be</supplied> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <supplied>from</supplied> the Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
</verse><verse>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
</verse><verse>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
</verse><verse>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <supplied>it</supplied> until the day of Jesus Christ:
</verse><verse>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
</verse><verse>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <supplied>in</supplied> all judgment;
</verse><verse>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
</verse><verse>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <supplied>which happened</supplied> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
</verse><verse>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <supplied>places; </supplied></verse><verse>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
</verse><verse>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
</verse><verse>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
</verse><verse>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
</verse><verse>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
</verse><verse>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
</verse><verse>According to my earnest expectation and <supplied>my</supplied> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <supplied>that</supplied> with all boldness, as always, <supplied>so</supplied> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <supplied>it be</supplied> by life, or by death.
</verse><verse>For to me to live <supplied>is</supplied> Christ, and to die <supplied>is</supplied> gain.
</verse><verse>But if I live in the flesh, this <supplied>is</supplied> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
</verse><verse>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
</verse><verse>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <supplied>is</supplied> more needful for you.
</verse><verse>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
</verse><verse>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
</verse><verse>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
</verse><verse>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
</verse><verse>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
</verse><verse>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <supplied>to be</supplied> in me.
