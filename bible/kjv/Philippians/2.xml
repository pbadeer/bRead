      <verse>If <supplied>there be</supplied> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
</verse><verse>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <supplied>being</supplied> of one accord, of one mind.
</verse><verse><supplied>Let</supplied> nothing <supplied>be done</supplied> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
</verse><verse>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
</verse><verse>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
</verse><verse>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
</verse><verse>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
</verse><verse>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
</verse><verse>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
</verse><verse>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <supplied>things</supplied> in heaven, and <supplied>things</supplied> in earth, and <supplied>things</supplied> under the earth;
</verse><verse>And <supplied>that</supplied> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <supplied>is</supplied> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
</verse><verse>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <supplied>his</supplied> good pleasure.
</verse><verse>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
</verse><verse>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
</verse><verse>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
</verse><verse>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
</verse><verse>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
</verse><verse>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
</verse><verse>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ&#x2019;s.
</verse><verse>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
</verse><verse>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
</verse><verse>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
</verse><verse>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
</verse><verse>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
</verse><verse>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
</verse><verse>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
</verse><verse>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
</verse><verse>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
     
      </verse>
