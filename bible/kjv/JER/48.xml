      <verse>Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded <supplied>and</supplied> taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
</verse><verse><supplied>There shall be</supplied> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <supplied>being</supplied> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
</verse><verse>A voice of crying <supplied>shall be</supplied> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
</verse><verse>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
</verse><verse>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
</verse><verse>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity <supplied>with</supplied> his priests and his princes together.
</verse><verse>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.
</verse><verse>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
</verse><verse>Cursed <supplied>be</supplied> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <supplied>be</supplied> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
</verse><verse>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
</verse><verse>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>How say ye, We <supplied>are</supplied> mighty and strong men for the war?
</verse><verse>Moab is spoiled, and gone up <supplied>out of</supplied> her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>The calamity of Moab <supplied>is</supplied> near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
</verse><verse>All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, <supplied>and</supplied> the beautiful rod!
</verse><verse>Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <supplied>thy</supplied> glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, <supplied>and</supplied> he shall destroy thy strong holds.
</verse><verse>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, <supplied>and</supplied> say, What is done?
</verse><verse>Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; and tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
</verse><verse>And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
</verse><verse>And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
</verse><verse>And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
</verse><verse>And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
</verse><verse>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Make ye him drunken: for he magnified <supplied>himself</supplied> against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
</verse><verse>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
</verse><verse>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove <supplied>that</supplied> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.
</verse><verse>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
</verse><verse>I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but <supplied>it shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> so; his lies shall not so effect <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; <supplied>mine heart</supplied> shall mourn for the men of Kir- heres.
</verse><verse>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <supplied>even</supplied> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
</verse><verse>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <supplied>their</supplied> shouting <supplied>shall be</supplied> no shouting.
</verse><verse>From the cry of Heshbon <supplied>even</supplied> unto Elealeh, <supplied>and even</supplied> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <supplied>even</supplied> unto Horonaim, <supplied>as</supplied> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
</verse><verse>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
</verse><verse>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches <supplied>that</supplied> he hath gotten are perished.
</verse><verse>For every head <supplied>shall be</supplied> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands <supplied>shall be</supplied> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
</verse><verse><supplied>There shall be</supplied> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein <supplied>is</supplied> no pleasure, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>They shall howl, <supplied>saying,</supplied> How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
</verse><verse>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
</verse><verse>And Moab shall be destroyed from <supplied>being</supplied> a people, because he hath magnified <supplied>himself</supplied> against the LORD.
</verse><verse>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <supplied>even</supplied> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
</verse><verse>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
</verse><verse>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far <supplied>is</supplied> the judgment of Moab.
