</verse><verse>But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou <supplied>art</supplied> afraid.
</verse><verse>For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.
