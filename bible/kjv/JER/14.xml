      <verse>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
</verse><verse>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
</verse><verse>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, <supplied>and</supplied> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
</verse><verse>Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
</verse><verse>Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook <supplied>it,</supplied> because there was no grass.
</verse><verse>And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because <supplied>there was</supplied> no grass.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou <supplied>it</supplied> for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
</verse><verse>O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man <supplied>that</supplied> turneth aside to tarry for a night?
</verse><verse>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man <supplied>that</supplied> cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, <supplied>art</supplied> in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
</verse><verse>Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for <supplied>their</supplied> good.
</verse><verse>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
</verse><verse>Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their
heart.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
</verse><verse>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their
wickedness upon them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
</verse><verse>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
</verse><verse>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and <supplied>there is</supplied> no healing for us? we looked for peace, and <supplied>there is</supplied> no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
</verse><verse>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, <supplied>and</supplied> the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
</verse><verse>Do not abhor <supplied>us,</supplied> for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
</verse><verse>Are there <supplied>any</supplied> among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? <supplied>art</supplied> not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these <supplied>things.</supplied>
