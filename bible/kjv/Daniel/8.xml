      <verse>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <supplied>even unto</supplied> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
</verse><verse>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <supplied>was</supplied> at Shushan <supplied>in</supplied> the palace, which <supplied>is</supplied> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
</verse><verse>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <supplied>two</supplied> horns: and the <supplied>two</supplied> horns <supplied>were</supplied> high; but one <supplied>was</supplied> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
</verse><verse>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <supplied>was there any</supplied> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
</verse><verse>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <supplied>had</supplied> a notable horn between his eyes.
</verse><verse>And he came to the ram that had <supplied>two</supplied> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
</verse><verse>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and
there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
</verse><verse>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
</verse><verse>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <supplied>land. </supplied></verse><verse>And it waxed great, <supplied>even</supplied> to the host of heaven; and it cast down
<supplied>some</supplied> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
</verse><verse>Yea, he magnified <supplied>himself</supplied> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <supplied>sacrifice</supplied> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
</verse><verse>And an host was given <supplied>him</supplied> against the daily <supplied>sacrifice</supplied> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <supplied>saint</supplied> which spake, How long <supplied>shall be</supplied> the vision <supplied>concerning</supplied> the daily <supplied>sacrifice,</supplied> and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, when I, <supplied>even</supplied> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
</verse><verse>And I heard a man&#x2019;s voice between <supplied>the banks of</supplied> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <supplied>man</supplied> to understand the vision.
</verse><verse>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <supplied>shall be</supplied> the vision.
</verse><verse>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
</verse><verse>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end <supplied>shall be. </supplied></verse><verse>The ram which thou sawest having <supplied>two</supplied> horns <supplied>are</supplied> the kings of Media and
Persia.
</verse><verse>And the rough goat <supplied>is</supplied> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that <supplied>is</supplied> between his eyes <supplied>is</supplied> the first king.
</verse><verse>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
</verse><verse>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
</verse><verse>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
</verse><verse>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <supplied>himself</supplied> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without
hand.
</verse><verse>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <supplied>is</supplied> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <supplied>shall be</supplied> for many days.
</verse><verse>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <supplied>certain</supplied> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king&#x2019;s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <supplied>it.</supplied>
