      <verse>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
</verse><verse>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <supplied>certain</supplied> of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;
</verse><verse>Children in whom <supplied>was</supplied> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <supplied>had</supplied> ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the
learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
</verse><verse>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
</verse><verse>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
</verse><verse>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <supplied>the name</supplied> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
</verse><verse>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
</verse><verse>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <supplied>are</supplied> of your sort? then shall ye make <supplied>me</supplied>
endanger my head to the king.
</verse><verse>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
</verse><verse>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
</verse><verse>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
</verse><verse>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
</verse><verse>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.
</verse><verse>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
</verse><verse>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
</verse><verse>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
</verse><verse>And in all matters of wisdom <supplied>and</supplied> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <supplied>and</supplied> astrologers that <supplied>were</supplied> in all his realm.
</verse><verse>And Daniel continued <supplied>even</supplied> unto the first year of king Cyrus.
