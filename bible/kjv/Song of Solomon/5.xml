<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="SNG" n="5">
      <verse>I am come into my garden, my sister, <supplied>my</supplied> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I sleep, but my heart waketh: <supplied>it is</supplied> the voice of my beloved that knocketh, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, <supplied>and</supplied> my locks with the drops of the night.
</verse><verse>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
</verse><verse>My beloved put in his hand by the hole <supplied>of the door,</supplied> and my bowels were moved for him.
</verse><verse>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped <supplied>with</supplied> myrrh, and my fingers <supplied>with</supplied> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
</verse><verse>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, <supplied>and</supplied> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
</verse><verse>The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
</verse><verse>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I <supplied>am</supplied> sick of love.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>What <supplied>is</supplied> thy beloved more than <supplied>another</supplied> beloved, O thou fairest among women? what <supplied>is</supplied> thy beloved more than <supplied>another</supplied> beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
</verse><verse>My beloved <supplied>is</supplied> white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
</verse><verse>His head <supplied>is as</supplied> the most fine gold, his locks <supplied>are</supplied> bushy, <supplied>and</supplied> black as a raven.
</verse><verse>His eyes <supplied>are</supplied> as <supplied>the eyes</supplied> of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, <supplied>and</supplied> fitly set.
</verse><verse>His cheeks <supplied>are</supplied> as a bed of spices, <supplied>as</supplied> sweet flowers: his lips <supplied>like</supplied> lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
</verse><verse>His hands <supplied>are as</supplied> gold rings set with the beryl: his belly <supplied>is as</supplied> bright ivory overlaid <supplied>with</supplied> sapphires.
</verse><verse>His legs <supplied>are as</supplied> pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance <supplied>is</supplied> as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
</verse><verse>His mouth <supplied>is</supplied> most sweet: yea, he <supplied>is</supplied> altogether lovely. This <supplied>is</supplied> my beloved, and this <supplied>is</supplied> my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
