      <verse>Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
</verse><verse>My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved <supplied>is</supplied> mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thou <supplied>art</supplied> beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as <supplied>an army</supplied> with banners.
</verse><verse>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair <supplied>is</supplied> as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
</verse><verse>Thy teeth <supplied>are</supplied> as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and <supplied>there is</supplied> not one barren among them.
</verse><verse>As a piece of a pomegranate <supplied>are</supplied> thy temples within thy locks.
</verse><verse>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
</verse><verse>My dove, my undefiled is <supplied>but</supplied> one; she <supplied>is</supplied> the <supplied>only</supplied> one of her mother, she <supplied>is</supplied> the choice <supplied>one</supplied> of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; <supplied>yea,</supplied> the queens and the concubines, and
they praised her.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> she <supplied>that</supplied> looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, <supplied>and</supplied> terrible as <supplied>an army</supplied> with banners?
</verse><verse>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, <supplied>and</supplied> to see whether the vine flourished, <supplied>and</supplied> the pomegranates budded.
</verse><verse>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me <supplied>like</supplied> the chariots of Amminadib.
</verse><verse>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
