      <verse>The song of songs, which <supplied>is</supplied> Solomon&#x2019;s.
</verse><verse>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <supplied>is</supplied> better than wine.
</verse><verse>Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <supplied>is as</supplied> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
</verse><verse>Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
</verse><verse>Look not upon me, because I <supplied>am</supplied> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother&#x2019;s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; <supplied>but</supplied> mine own vineyard have I not kept.
</verse><verse>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest <supplied>thy flock</supplied> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds&#x2019; tents.
</verse><verse>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots.
</verse><verse>Thy cheeks are comely with rows <supplied>of jewels,</supplied> thy neck with chains <supplied>of gold. </supplied></verse><verse>We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>While the king <supplied>sitteth</supplied> at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
</verse><verse>A bundle of myrrh <supplied>is</supplied> my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
</verse><verse>My beloved <supplied>is</supplied> unto me <supplied>as</supplied> a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.
</verse><verse>Behold, thou <supplied>art</supplied> fair, my love; behold, thou <supplied>art</supplied> fair; thou <supplied>hast</supplied> doves&#x2019; eyes.
</verse><verse>Behold, thou <supplied>art</supplied> fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed <supplied>is</supplied> green.
</verse><verse>The beams of our house <supplied>are</supplied> cedar, <supplied>and</supplied> our rafters of fir.
