      <verse>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
</verse><verse>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same <supplied>is</supplied> a perfect man, <supplied>and</supplied> able also to bridle the whole body.
</verse><verse>Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
</verse><verse>Behold also the ships, which though <supplied>they be</supplied> so great, and <supplied>are</supplied> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
</verse><verse>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
</verse><verse>And the tongue <supplied>is</supplied> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
</verse><verse>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
</verse><verse>But the tongue can no man tame; <supplied>it is</supplied> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
</verse><verse>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
</verse><verse>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
</verse><verse>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <supplied>water</supplied> and bitter?
</verse><verse>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so <supplied>can</supplied> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
</verse><verse>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
</verse><verse>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <supplied>is</supplied> earthly, sensual, devilish.
</verse><verse>For where envying and strife <supplied>is,</supplied> there <supplied>is</supplied> confusion and every evil work.
</verse><verse>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <supplied>and</supplied> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
</verse><verse>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
