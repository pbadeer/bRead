      <verse>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
</verse><verse>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
</verse><verse>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
</verse><verse>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
</verse><verse>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
</verse><verse>Therefore let us not sleep, as <supplied>do</supplied> others; but let us watch and be sober.
</verse><verse>For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
</verse><verse>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
</verse><verse>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
</verse><verse>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
</verse><verse>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
</verse><verse>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work&#x2019;s sake. <supplied>And</supplied> be at peace among yourselves.
</verse><verse>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <supplied>men. </supplied></verse><verse>See that none render evil for evil unto any <supplied>man;</supplied> but ever follow that which is good, both
among yourselves, and to all <supplied>men. </supplied></verse><verse>Rejoice evermore.
</verse><verse>Pray without ceasing.
</verse><verse>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
</verse><verse>Quench not the Spirit.
</verse><verse>Despise not prophesyings.
</verse><verse>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
</verse><verse>Abstain from all appearance of evil.
</verse><verse>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <supplied>I pray God</supplied> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>Faithful <supplied>is</supplied> he that calleth you, who also will do <supplied>it.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Brethren, pray for us.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
</verse><verse>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with you. Amen.
