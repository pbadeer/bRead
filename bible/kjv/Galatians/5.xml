      <verse>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
</verse><verse>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
</verse><verse>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
</verse><verse>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
</verse><verse>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
</verse><verse>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
</verse><verse>This persuasion <supplied>cometh</supplied> not of him that calleth you.
</verse><verse>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
</verse><verse>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
</verse><verse>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
</verse><verse>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
</verse><verse>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <supplied>use</supplied> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
</verse><verse>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <supplied>even</supplied> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
</verse><verse>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
</verse><verse><supplied>This</supplied> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
</verse><verse>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
</verse><verse>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
</verse><verse>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <supplied>these;</supplied> Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
</verse><verse>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
</verse><verse>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <supplied>you</supplied> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
</verse><verse>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
</verse><verse>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
</verse><verse>And they that are Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
</verse><verse>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
</verse><verse>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
