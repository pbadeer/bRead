      <verse>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
</verse><verse>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
</verse><verse>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <supplied>is</supplied> in thine heart; for the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> with thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
</verse><verse>Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
</verse><verse>Whereas I have not dwelt in <supplied>any</supplied> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
</verse><verse>In all <supplied>the places</supplied> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
</verse><verse>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
</verse><verse>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <supplied>men</supplied> that <supplied>are</supplied> in the earth.
</verse><verse>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
</verse><verse>And as since the time that I commanded judges <supplied>to be</supplied> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
</verse><verse>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
</verse><verse>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
</verse><verse>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <supplied>it</supplied> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
</verse><verse>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
</verse><verse>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who <supplied>am</supplied> I, O Lord GOD? and what <supplied>is</supplied> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
</verse><verse>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And <supplied>is</supplied> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
</verse><verse>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
</verse><verse>For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <supplied>there is</supplied> none like thee, neither <supplied>is there any</supplied>
God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
</verse><verse>And what one nation in the earth <supplied>is</supplied> like thy people, <supplied>even</supplied> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which
thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <supplied>from</supplied> the nations and their gods?
</verse><verse>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <supplied>to be</supplied> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.
</verse><verse>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish <supplied>it</supplied> for ever, and do as thou hast said.
</verse><verse>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
</verse><verse>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
</verse><verse>And now, O Lord GOD, thou <supplied>art</supplied> that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
</verse><verse>Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken <supplied>it:</supplied> and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
