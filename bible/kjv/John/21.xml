      <verse>After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <supplied>himself. </supplied></verse><verse>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the
<supplied>sons</supplied> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
</verse><verse>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
</verse><verse>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Children, have ye any meat?</jesus> They answered him, No.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</jesus> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
</verse><verse>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <supplied>his</supplied> fisher&#x2019;s coat <supplied>unto him,</supplied> (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
</verse><verse>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
</verse><verse>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. </jesus></verse><verse>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Come <supplied>and</supplied> dine.</jesus> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
</verse><verse>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
</verse><verse>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <jesus>Simon, <supplied>son</supplied> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</jesus> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <jesus>Feed my lambs. </jesus></verse><verse>He saith to
him again the second time, <jesus>Simon, <supplied>son</supplied> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</jesus> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <jesus>Feed my sheep. </jesus></verse><verse>He saith unto him the third time, <jesus>Simon, <supplied>son</supplied> of
Jonas, lovest thou me?</jesus> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>Feed my sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <supplied>thee</supplied> whither thou wouldest not.
</jesus></verse><verse>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <jesus>Follow me. </jesus></verse><verse>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his
breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
</verse><verse>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <supplied>shall</supplied> this man <supplied>do? </supplied></verse><verse>Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>If I will that he tarry till I come, what <supplied>is that</supplied> to thee? follow thou me. </jesus></verse><verse>Then went this saying abroad among
the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, <jesus>If I will that he tarry till I come, what <supplied>is that</supplied> to thee? </jesus></verse><verse>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
</verse><verse>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
