      <verse>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
</verse><verse>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
</verse><verse>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto her, <jesus>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. </jesus></verse><verse>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Fill the waterpots with water.</jesus> And they filled them up to the brim.
</verse><verse>And he saith unto them, <jesus>Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</jesus> And they bare <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
</verse><verse>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <supplied>but</supplied> thou hast kept the good wine until now.
</verse><verse>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the Jews&#x2019; passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
</verse><verse>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
</verse><verse>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#x2019; money, and overthrew the tables;
</verse><verse>And said unto them that sold doves, <jesus>Take these things hence; make not my Father&#x2019;s house an house of merchandise. </jesus></verse><verse>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto them, <jesus>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
</verse><verse>But he spake of the temple of his body.
</verse><verse>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <supplied>day,</supplied> many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
</verse><verse>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <supplied>men, </supplied></verse><verse>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
