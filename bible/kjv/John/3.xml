      <verse>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
</verse><verse>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto him, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </jesus></verse><verse>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his
mother&#x2019;s womb, and be born?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <supplied>of</supplied> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is
born of the Spirit. </jesus></verse><verse>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto him, <jesus>Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <supplied>of</supplied> heavenly things? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <supplied>even</supplied> the Son of man
which is in heaven.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the
world through him might be saved.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into
the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that doeth truth
cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
</verse><verse>For John was not yet cast into prison.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then there arose a question between <supplied>some</supplied> of John&#x2019;s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
</verse><verse>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <supplied>men</supplied> come to him.
</verse><verse>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
</verse><verse>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
</verse><verse>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom&#x2019;s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
</verse><verse>He must increase, but I <supplied>must</supplied> decrease.
</verse><verse>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
</verse><verse>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
</verse><verse>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
</verse><verse>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <supplied>unto him. </supplied></verse><verse>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
</verse><verse>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
