      <verse>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
</verse><verse>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD&#x2019;S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.
</verse><verse>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
</verse><verse>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
</verse><verse>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <supplied>and</supplied> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
</verse><verse>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <supplied>or</supplied> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <supplied>for</supplied> my transgression, the fruit of my body <supplied>for</supplied> the sin of my soul?
</verse><verse>He hath shewed thee, O man, what <supplied>is</supplied> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
</verse><verse>The LORD&#x2019;S voice crieth unto the city, and <supplied>the man of</supplied> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <supplied>that is</supplied> abominable?
</verse><verse>Shall I count <supplied>them</supplied> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
</verse><verse>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <supplied>is</supplied> deceitful in their mouth.
</verse><verse>Therefore also will I make <supplied>thee</supplied> sick in smiting thee, in making <supplied>thee</supplied> desolate because of thy sins.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <supplied>shall be</supplied> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <supplied>that</supplied> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
