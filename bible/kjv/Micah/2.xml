      <verse>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
</verse><verse>And they covet fields, and take <supplied>them</supplied> by violence; and houses, and take <supplied>them</supplied> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <supplied>is</supplied> evil.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In that day shall <supplied>one</supplied> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <supplied>and</supplied> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <supplied>it</supplied> from me! turning away he hath
divided our fields.
</verse><verse>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
</verse><verse>Prophesy ye not, <supplied>say they to them that</supplied> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <supplied>that</supplied> they shall not take shame.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O <supplied>thou that art</supplied> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <supplied>are</supplied> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
</verse><verse>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
</verse><verse>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
</verse><verse>Arise ye, and depart; for this <supplied>is</supplied> not <supplied>your</supplied> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <supplied>you,</supplied> even with a sore destruction.
</verse><verse>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <supplied>saying,</supplied> I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <supplied>the multitude
of</supplied> men.
</verse><verse>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
