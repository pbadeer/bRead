      <verse>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <supplied>and</supplied> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
</verse><verse>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
</verse><verse>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <supplied>and</supplied> as the waters <supplied>that are</supplied> poured down a steep place.
</verse><verse>For the transgression of Jacob <supplied>is</supplied> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <supplied>is</supplied> the transgression of Jacob? <supplied>is it</supplied> not Samaria? and what <supplied>are</supplied> the high places of Judah? <supplied>are they</supplied> not Jerusalem?
</verse><verse>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <supplied>and</supplied> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
</verse><verse>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <supplied>it</supplied> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to
the hire of an harlot.
</verse><verse>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
</verse><verse>For her wound <supplied>is</supplied> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <supplied>even</supplied> to Jerusalem.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Declare ye <supplied>it</supplied> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
</verse><verse>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
</verse><verse>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <supplied>is</supplied> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
</verse><verse>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib <supplied>shall be</supplied> a lie to the kings of Israel.
</verse><verse>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
</verse><verse>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
