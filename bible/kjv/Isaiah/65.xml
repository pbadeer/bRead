      <verse>I am sought of <supplied>them that</supplied> asked not <supplied>for me;</supplied> I am found of <supplied>them that</supplied> sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation <supplied>that</supplied> was not called by my name.
</verse><verse>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way <supplied>that was</supplied> not good, after their own thoughts;
</verse><verse>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
</verse><verse>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine&#x2019;s flesh, and broth of abominable <supplied>things is in</supplied> their vessels;
</verse><verse>Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. <supplied>These</supplied> are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
</verse><verse>Behold, <supplied>it is</supplied> written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
</verse><verse>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and <supplied>one</supplied> saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing <supplied>is</supplied> in it: so will I do for my servants&#x2019; sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
</verse><verse>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
</verse><verse>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But ye <supplied>are</supplied> they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
</verse><verse>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose <supplied>that</supplied> wherein I delighted not.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
</verse><verse>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
</verse><verse>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
</verse><verse>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
</verse><verse>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <supplied>in that</supplied> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
</verse><verse>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
</verse><verse>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <supplied>being</supplied> an hundred years old shall be accursed.
</verse><verse>And they shall build houses, and inhabit <supplied>them;</supplied> and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
</verse><verse>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree <supplied>are</supplied> the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
</verse><verse>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they <supplied>are</supplied> the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
</verse><verse>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust <supplied>shall be</supplied> the serpent&#x2019;s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
