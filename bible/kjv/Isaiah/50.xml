      <verse>Thus saith the LORD, Where <supplied>is</supplied> the bill of your mother&#x2019;s divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors <supplied>is it</supplied> to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your
transgressions is your mother put away.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, when I came, <supplied>was there</supplied> no man? when I called, <supplied>was there</supplied> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a
wilderness: their fish stinketh, because <supplied>there is</supplied> no water, and dieth for thirst.
</verse><verse>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
</verse><verse>The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <supplied>him that is</supplied> weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.
</verse><verse>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
</verse><verse><supplied>He is</supplied> near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who <supplied>is</supplied> mine adversary? let him come near to me.
</verse><verse>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who <supplied>is</supplied> he <supplied>that</supplied> shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh <supplied>in</supplied> darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.
</verse><verse>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass <supplied>yourselves</supplied> about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks <supplied>that</supplied> ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
