<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" n="10" book-chapters="66">
      <verse>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness <supplied>which</supplied> they have prescribed;
</verse><verse>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and <supplied>that</supplied> they may rob the fatherless!
</verse><verse>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation <supplied>which</supplied> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
</verse><verse>Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <supplied>is</supplied> stretched out still.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
</verse><verse>I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
</verse><verse>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but <supplied>it is</supplied> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
</verse><verse>For he saith, <supplied>Are</supplied> not my princes altogether kings?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> not Calno as Carchemish? <supplied>is</supplied> not Hamath as Arpad? <supplied>is</supplied> not Samaria as Damascus?
</verse><verse>As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
</verse><verse>Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
</verse><verse>Wherefore it shall come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
</verse><verse>For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done <supplied>it,</supplied> and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant <supplied>man:
</supplied></verse><verse>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs <supplied>that are</supplied> left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
</verse><verse>Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? <supplied>or</supplied> shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake <supplied>itself</supplied> against them that lift it up, <supplied>or</supplied> as if the staff should lift
up <supplied>itself, as if it were</supplied> no wood.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
</verse><verse>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
</verse><verse>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.
</verse><verse>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it shall come to pass in that day, <supplied>that</supplied> the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
</verse><verse>The remnant shall return, <supplied>even</supplied> the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
</verse><verse>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, <supplied>yet</supplied> a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
</verse><verse>For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
</verse><verse>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
</verse><verse>And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and <supplied>as</supplied> his rod <supplied>was</supplied> upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass in that day, <supplied>that</supplied> his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
</verse><verse>He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
</verse><verse>They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
</verse><verse>Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
</verse><verse>Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
</verse><verse>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand <supplied>against</supplied> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature <supplied>shall be</supplied> hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
</verse><verse>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
