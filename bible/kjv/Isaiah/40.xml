      <verse>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
</verse><verse>Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD&#x2019;S hand double for all her sins.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
</verse><verse>Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
</verse><verse>And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see <supplied>it</supplied> together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh <supplied>is</supplied> grass, and all the
goodliness thereof <supplied>is</supplied> as the flower of the field:
</verse><verse>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people <supplied>is</supplied> grass.
</verse><verse>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift <supplied>it</supplied> up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
</verse><verse>Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong <supplied>hand,</supplied> and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward <supplied>is</supplied> with him, and his work before him.
</verse><verse>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry <supplied>them</supplied> in his bosom, <supplied>and</supplied> shall gently lead those that are with young.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
</verse><verse>Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or <supplied>being</supplied> his counsellor hath taught him?
</verse><verse>With whom took he counsel, and <supplied>who</supplied> instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
</verse><verse>Behold, the nations <supplied>are</supplied> as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
</verse><verse>And Lebanon <supplied>is</supplied> not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
</verse><verse>All nations before him <supplied>are</supplied> as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
</verse><verse>The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
</verse><verse>He that <supplied>is</supplied> so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree <supplied>that</supplied> will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, <supplied>that</supplied> shall not be moved.
</verse><verse>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof <supplied>are</supplied> as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
</verse><verse>That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
</verse><verse>Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
</verse><verse>To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
</verse><verse>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these <supplied>things,</supplied> that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that <supplied>he is</supplied> strong in power; not one faileth.
</verse><verse>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, <supplied>that</supplied> the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? <supplied>there is</supplied> no searching of his understanding.
</verse><verse>He giveth power to the faint; and to <supplied>them that have</supplied> no might he increaseth strength.
</verse><verse>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
</verse><verse>But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew <supplied>their</supplied> strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; <supplied>and</supplied> they shall walk, and not faint.
