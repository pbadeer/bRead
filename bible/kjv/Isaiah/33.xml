      <verse>Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou <supplied>wast</supplied> not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; <supplied>and</supplied> when thou shalt make an end to deal

      </verse>
      <verse>Hear, ye <supplied>that are</supplied> far off, what I have done; and, ye <supplied>that are</supplied> near, acknowledge my might.
</verse><verse>The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
</verse><verse>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

</verse><verse>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.

</verse><verse>For the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> our judge, the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> our lawgiver, the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> our king; he will save us.
</verse><verse>Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
</verse><verse>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein <supplied>shall be</supplied> forgiven <supplied>their</supplied> iniquity.
