      <verse>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
</verse><verse>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, <supplied>there is</supplied> no beauty that we should desire him.
</verse><verse>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were <supplied>our</supplied> faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
</verse><verse>But he <supplied>was</supplied> wounded for our transgressions, <supplied>he was</supplied> bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace <supplied>was</supplied> upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
</verse><verse>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
</verse><verse>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
</verse><verse>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
</verse><verse>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither <supplied>was any</supplied> deceit in his mouth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <supplied>him</supplied> to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <supplied>his</supplied> seed, he shall prolong <supplied>his</supplied> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his
hand.
</verse><verse>He shall see of the travail of his soul, <supplied>and</supplied> shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
</verse><verse>Therefore will I divide him <supplied>a portion</supplied> with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors.
