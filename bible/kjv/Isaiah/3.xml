      <verse>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,
</verse><verse>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
</verse><verse>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
</verse><verse>And I will give children <supplied>to be</supplied> their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
</verse><verse>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
</verse><verse>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and <supplied>let</supplied> this ruin <supplied>be</supplied> under thy hand:
</verse><verse>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house <supplied>is</supplied> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
</verse><verse>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings <supplied>are</supplied> against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide <supplied>it</supplied> not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
</verse><verse>Say ye to the righteous, that <supplied>it shall be</supplied> well <supplied>with him:</supplied> for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
</verse><verse>Woe unto the wicked! <supplied>it shall be</supplied> ill <supplied>with him:</supplied> for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>As for</supplied> my people, children <supplied>are</supplied> their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause <supplied>thee</supplied> to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
</verse><verse>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
</verse><verse>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor <supplied>is</supplied> in your houses.
</verse><verse>What mean ye <supplied>that</supplied> ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing <supplied>as</supplied> they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
</verse><verse>Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
</verse><verse>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <supplied>their</supplied> tinkling ornaments <supplied>about their feet,</supplied> and <supplied>their</supplied> cauls, and <supplied>their</supplied> round tires like the moon,
</verse><verse>The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
</verse><verse>The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
</verse><verse>The rings, and nose jewels,
</verse><verse>The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
</verse><verse>The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; <supplied>and</supplied> burning instead of
beauty.
</verse><verse>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
</verse><verse>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she <supplied>being</supplied> desolate shall sit upon the ground.
