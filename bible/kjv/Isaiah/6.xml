      <verse>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
</verse><verse>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
</verse><verse>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <supplied>is</supplied> full of his glory.
</verse><verse>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said I, Woe <supplied>is</supplied> me! for I am undone; because I <supplied>am</supplied> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <supplied>which</supplied> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
</verse><verse>And he laid <supplied>it</supplied> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
</verse><verse>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I; send me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
</verse><verse>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
</verse><verse>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
</verse><verse>And the LORD have removed men far away, and <supplied>there be</supplied> a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But yet in it <supplied>shall be</supplied> a tenth, and <supplied>it</supplied> shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast <supplied>their leaves: so</supplied> the holy seed <supplied>shall be</supplied> the substance
thereof.
