      <verse>But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called <supplied>thee</supplied> by thy name; thou <supplied>art</supplied> mine.
</verse><verse>When thou passest through the waters, I <supplied>will be</supplied> with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
</verse><verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt <supplied>for</supplied> thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
</verse><verse>Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
</verse><verse>Fear not: for I <supplied>am</supplied> with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
</verse><verse>I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
</verse><verse><supplied>Even</supplied> every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
</verse><verse>Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, <supplied>It is</supplied>
truth.
</verse><verse>Ye <supplied>are</supplied> my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I <supplied>am</supplied> he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
</verse><verse>I, <supplied>even</supplied> I, <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD; and beside me <supplied>there is</supplied> no saviour.
</verse><verse>I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when <supplied>there was</supplied> no strange <supplied>god</supplied> among you: therefore ye <supplied>are</supplied> my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I <supplied>am</supplied> God.
</verse><verse>Yea, before the day <supplied>was</supplied> I <supplied>am</supplied> he; and <supplied>there is</supplied> none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry <supplied>is</supplied> in the ships.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
</verse><verse>Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
</verse><verse>Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, <supplied>and</supplied> rivers in the desert.
</verse><verse>The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, <supplied>and</supplied> rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
</verse><verse>This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
</verse><verse>Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
</verse><verse>Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
</verse><verse>I, <supplied>even</supplied> I, <supplied>am</supplied> he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
</verse><verse>Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
</verse><verse>Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
</verse><verse>Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
