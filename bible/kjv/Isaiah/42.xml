<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="ISA" n="42">
      <verse>Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, <supplied>in whom</supplied> my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
</verse><verse>He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
</verse><verse>A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
</verse><verse>He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
</verse><verse>I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
</verse><verse>To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, <supplied>and</supplied> them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD: that <supplied>is</supplied> my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
</verse><verse>Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
</verse><verse>Sing unto the LORD a new song, <supplied>and</supplied> his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
</verse><verse>Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <supplied>their voice,</supplied> the villages <supplied>that</supplied> Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
</verse><verse>Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.
</verse><verse>The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.
</verse><verse>I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, <supplied>and</supplied> refrained myself: <supplied>now</supplied> will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
</verse><verse>I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
</verse><verse>And I will bring the blind by a way <supplied>that</supplied> they knew not; I will lead them in paths <supplied>that</supplied> they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake
them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> our gods.
</verse><verse>Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger <supplied>that</supplied> I sent? who <supplied>is</supplied> blind as <supplied>he that is</supplied> perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?
</verse><verse>Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.
</verse><verse>The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make <supplied>it</supplied> honourable.
</verse><verse>But this <supplied>is</supplied> a people robbed and spoiled; <supplied>they are</supplied> all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
</verse><verse>Who among you will give ear to this? <supplied>who</supplied> will hearken and hear for the time to come?
</verse><verse>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.
</verse><verse>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid <supplied>it</supplied> not to heart.
