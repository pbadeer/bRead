      <verse>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
</verse><verse>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore have we fasted, <supplied>say they,</supplied> and thou seest not? <supplied>wherefore</supplied> have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
</verse><verse>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as <supplied>ye do this</supplied> day, to make your voice to be heard on high.
</verse><verse>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? <supplied>is it</supplied> to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes <supplied>under him?</supplied> wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is it</supplied> not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.
</verse><verse>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I <supplied>am.</supplied> If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;
</verse><verse>And <supplied>if</supplied> thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness <supplied>be</supplied> as the noonday:
</verse><verse>And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>they that shall be</supplied> of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <supplied>from</supplied> doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor
speaking <supplied>thine own</supplied> words:
</verse><verse>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <supplied>it.</supplied>
