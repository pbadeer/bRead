      <verse>Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: <supplied>there is</supplied> no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
</verse><verse>Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
</verse><verse>Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet <supplied>thee as</supplied> a man.
</verse><verse><supplied>As for</supplied> our redeemer, the LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> his name, the Holy One of Israel.
</verse><verse>Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: <supplied>so</supplied> that thou didst not lay these <supplied>things</supplied> to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
</verse><verse>Therefore hear now this, <supplied>thou that art</supplied> given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I <supplied>am,</supplied> and none else beside me; I shall not sit <supplied>as</supplied> a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:
</verse><verse>But these two <supplied>things</supplied> shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, <supplied>and</supplied> for the great abundance of thine
enchantments.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I <supplied>am,</supplied> and none else beside me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put if off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, <supplied>which</supplied> thou shalt not know.
</verse><verse>Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
</verse><verse>Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from <supplied>these things</supplied> that shall come upon thee.
</verse><verse>Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <supplied>there shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> a coal to warm at, <supplied>nor</supplied> fire to sit before it.
</verse><verse>Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, <supplied>even</supplied> thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
