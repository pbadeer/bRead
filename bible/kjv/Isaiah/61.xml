      <verse>The Spirit of the Lord GOD <supplied>is</supplied> upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to
<supplied>them that are</supplied> bound;
</verse><verse>To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
</verse><verse>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he
might be glorified.

      <verse>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
</verse><verse>And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <supplied>shall be</supplied> your plowmen and your vinedressers.
</verse><verse>But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: <supplied>men</supplied> shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

      <verse>For your shame <supplied>ye shall have</supplied> double; and <supplied>for</supplied> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.
</verse><verse>For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
</verse><verse>And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they <supplied>are</supplied> the seed <supplied>which</supplied> the LORD hath blessed.
</verse><verse>I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh <supplied>himself</supplied> with ornaments, and as a
bride adorneth <supplied>herself</supplied> with her jewels.
</verse><verse>For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
