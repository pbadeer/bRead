      <verse>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <supplied>us</supplied> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
</verse><verse>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in
my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
</verse><verse>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <supplied>day</supplied> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
</verse><verse>And in this <supplied>place</supplied> again, If they shall enter into my rest.
</verse><verse>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
</verse><verse>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
</verse><verse>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
</verse><verse>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
</verse><verse>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <supplied>did</supplied> from his.
</verse><verse>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
</verse><verse>For the word of God <supplied>is</supplied> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <supplied>is</supplied> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the
heart.
</verse><verse>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things <supplied>are</supplied> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
</verse><verse>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <supplied>our</supplied> profession.
</verse><verse>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <supplied>we are, yet</supplied> without sin.
</verse><verse>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
