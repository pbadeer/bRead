      <verse>Let brotherly love continue.
</verse><verse>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
</verse><verse>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; <supplied>and</supplied> them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
</verse><verse>Marriage <supplied>is</supplied> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
</verse><verse><supplied>Let your</supplied> conversation <supplied>be</supplied> without covetousness; <supplied>and be</supplied> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
</verse><verse>So that we may boldly say, The Lord <supplied>is</supplied> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of <supplied>their</supplied> conversation.
</verse><verse>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
</verse><verse>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For <supplied>it is</supplied> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
</verse><verse>We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
</verse><verse>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
</verse><verse>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
</verse><verse>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
</verse><verse>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
</verse><verse>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <supplied>our</supplied> lips giving thanks to his name.
</verse><verse>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
</verse><verse>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <supplied>is</supplied> unprofitable for you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
</verse><verse>But I beseech <supplied>you</supplied> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
</verse><verse>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
</verse><verse>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <supplied>be</supplied> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</verse><verse>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
</verse><verse>Know ye that <supplied>our</supplied> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Grace <supplied>be</supplied> with you all. Amen.
