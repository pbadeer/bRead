      <verse>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
</verse><verse>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
</verse><verse>And this will we do, if God permit.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>it is</supplied> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
</verse><verse>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
</verse><verse>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put <supplied>him</supplied> to an open shame.
</verse><verse>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
</verse><verse>But that which beareth thorns and briers <supplied>is</supplied> rejected, and <supplied>is</supplied> nigh unto cursing; whose end <supplied>is</supplied> to be burned.
</verse><verse>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
</verse><verse>For God <supplied>is</supplied> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
</verse><verse>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
</verse><verse>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
</verse><verse>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
</verse><verse>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
</verse><verse>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
</verse><verse>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation <supplied>is</supplied> to them an end of all strife.
</verse><verse>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed <supplied>it</supplied> by an oath:
</verse><verse>That by two immutable things, in which <supplied>it was</supplied> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
</verse><verse>Which <supplied>hope</supplied> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
</verse><verse>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <supplied>even</supplied> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
