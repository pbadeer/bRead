      <verse>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
</verse><verse>For by it the elders obtained a good report.
</verse><verse>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
</verse><verse>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
</verse><verse>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
</verse><verse>But without faith <supplied>it is</supplied> impossible to please <supplied>him:</supplied> for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <supplied>that</supplied> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
</verse><verse>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
</verse><verse>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
</verse><verse>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <supplied>in</supplied> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
</verse><verse>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <supplied>is</supplied> God.
</verse><verse>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
</verse><verse>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <supplied>so many</supplied> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
</verse><verse>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <supplied>them,</supplied> and embraced <supplied>them,</supplied> and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
</verse><verse>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
</verse><verse>And truly, if they had been mindful of that <supplied>country</supplied> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
</verse><verse>But now they desire a better <supplied>country,</supplied> that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
</verse><verse>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <supplied>son, </supplied></verse><verse>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
</verse><verse>Accounting that God <supplied>was</supplied> able to raise <supplied>him</supplied> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
</verse><verse>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
</verse><verse>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <supplied>leaning</supplied> upon the top of his staff.
</verse><verse>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
</verse><verse>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <supplied>he was</supplied> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king&#x2019;s commandment.
</verse><verse>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter;
</verse><verse>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
</verse><verse>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
</verse><verse>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
</verse><verse>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
</verse><verse>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <supplied>land:</supplied> which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
</verse><verse>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
</verse><verse>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
</verse><verse>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <supplied>of</supplied> Barak, and <supplied>of</supplied> Samson, and <supplied>of</supplied> Jephthae; <supplied>of</supplied> David also, and Samuel, and <supplied>of</supplied> the prophets:
</verse><verse>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
</verse><verse>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
</verse><verse>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
</verse><verse>And others had trial of <supplied>cruel</supplied> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
</verse><verse>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
</verse><verse>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <supplied>in</supplied> mountains, and <supplied>in</supplied> dens and caves of the earth.
</verse><verse>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
</verse><verse>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
