      <verse>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
</verse><verse>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
</verse><verse>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
</verse><verse>Now consider how great this man <supplied>was,</supplied> unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
</verse><verse>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
</verse><verse>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
</verse><verse>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
</verse><verse>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <supplied>receiveth them,</supplied> of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
</verse><verse>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
</verse><verse>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
</verse><verse>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <supplied>was there</supplied> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of
Aaron?
</verse><verse>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
</verse><verse>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>it is</supplied> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
</verse><verse>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
</verse><verse>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
</verse><verse>For he testifieth, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
</verse><verse>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
</verse><verse>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <supplied>did;</supplied> by the which we draw nigh unto God.
</verse><verse>And inasmuch as not without an oath <supplied>he was made priest: </supplied></verse><verse>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> a priest for ever after
the order of Melchisedec:)
</verse><verse>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
</verse><verse>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
</verse><verse>But this <supplied>man,</supplied> because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
</verse><verse>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
</verse><verse>For such an high priest became us, <supplied>who is</supplied> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
</verse><verse>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people&#x2019;s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
</verse><verse>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <supplied>maketh</supplied> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
