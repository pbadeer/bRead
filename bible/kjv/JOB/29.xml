<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="JOB" n="29">
      <verse>Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
</verse><verse>Oh that I were as <supplied>in</supplied> months past, as <supplied>in</supplied> the days <supplied>when</supplied> God preserved me;
</verse><verse>When his candle shined upon my head, <supplied>and when</supplied> by his light I walked <supplied>through</supplied> darkness;
</verse><verse>As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God <supplied>was</supplied> upon my tabernacle;
</verse><verse>When the Almighty <supplied>was</supplied> yet with me, <supplied>when</supplied> my children <supplied>were</supplied> about me;
</verse><verse>When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
</verse><verse>When I went out to the gate through the city, <supplied>when</supplied> I prepared my seat in the street!
</verse><verse>The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <supplied>and</supplied> stood up.
</verse><verse>The princes refrained talking, and laid <supplied>their</supplied> hand on their mouth.
</verse><verse>The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
</verse><verse>When the ear heard <supplied>me,</supplied> then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <supplied>me,</supplied> it gave witness to me:
</verse><verse>Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <supplied>him that had</supplied> none to help him.
</verse><verse>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.
</verse><verse>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <supplied>was</supplied> as a robe and a diadem.
</verse><verse>I was eyes to the blind, and feet <supplied>was</supplied> I to the lame.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>was</supplied> a father to the poor: and the cause <supplied>which</supplied> I knew not I searched out.
</verse><verse>And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
</verse><verse>Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply <supplied>my</supplied> days as the sand.
</verse><verse>My root <supplied>was</supplied> spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
</verse><verse>My glory <supplied>was</supplied> fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
</verse><verse>Unto me <supplied>men</supplied> gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
</verse><verse>After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
</verse><verse>And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <supplied>as</supplied> for the latter rain.
</verse><verse><supplied>If</supplied> I laughed on them, they believed <supplied>it</supplied> not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
</verse><verse>I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one <supplied>that</supplied> comforteth the mourners.
