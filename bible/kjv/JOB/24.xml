      <verse>Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
</verse><verse><supplied>Some</supplied> remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed <supplied>thereof. </supplied></verse><verse>They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow&#x2019;s ox for a pledge.
</verse><verse>They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
</verse><verse>Behold, <supplied>as</supplied> wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness <supplied>yieldeth</supplied> food for them <supplied>and</supplied> for <supplied>their</supplied> children.
</verse><verse>They reap <supplied>every one</supplied> his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
</verse><verse>They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that <supplied>they have</supplied> no covering in the cold.
</verse><verse>They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
</verse><verse>They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
</verse><verse>They cause <supplied>him</supplied> to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf <supplied>from</supplied> the hungry;
</verse><verse><supplied>Which</supplied> make oil within their walls, <supplied>and</supplied> tread <supplied>their</supplied> winepresses, and suffer thirst.
</verse><verse>Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly <supplied>to them. </supplied></verse><verse>They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
</verse><verse>The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
</verse><verse>The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth <supplied>his</supplied> face.
</verse><verse>In the dark they dig through houses, <supplied>which</supplied> they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
</verse><verse>For the morning <supplied>is</supplied> to them even as the shadow of death: if <supplied>one</supplied> know <supplied>them, they are in</supplied> the terrors of the shadow of death.
</verse><verse>He <supplied>is</supplied> swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
</verse><verse>Drought and heat consume the snow waters: <supplied>so doth</supplied> the grave <supplied>those which</supplied> have sinned.
</verse><verse>The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
</verse><verse>He evil entreateth the barren that <supplied>beareth</supplied> not: and doeth not good to the widow.
</verse><verse>He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no <supplied>man</supplied> is sure of life.
</verse><verse><supplied>Though</supplied> it be given him <supplied>to be</supplied> in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes <supplied>are</supplied> upon their ways.
</verse><verse>They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all <supplied>other,</supplied> and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
</verse><verse>And if <supplied>it be</supplied> not <supplied>so</supplied> now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
