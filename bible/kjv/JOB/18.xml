      <verse>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
</verse><verse>How long <supplied>will it be ere</supplied> ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
</verse><verse>Wherefore are we counted as beasts, <supplied>and</supplied> reputed vile in your sight?
</verse><verse>He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
</verse><verse>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
</verse><verse>The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
</verse><verse>The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
</verse><verse>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
</verse><verse>The gin shall take <supplied>him</supplied> by the heel, <supplied>and</supplied> the robber shall prevail against him.
</verse><verse>The snare <supplied>is</supplied> laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
</verse><verse>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
</verse><verse>His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction <supplied>shall be</supplied> ready at his side.
</verse><verse>It shall devour the strength of his skin: <supplied>even</supplied> the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
</verse><verse>His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
</verse><verse>It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because <supplied>it is</supplied> none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
</verse><verse>His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
</verse><verse>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
</verse><verse>He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
</verse><verse>He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
</verse><verse>They that come after <supplied>him</supplied> shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
</verse><verse>Surely such <supplied>are</supplied> the dwellings of the wicked, and this <supplied>is</supplied> the place <supplied>of him that</supplied> knoweth not God.
