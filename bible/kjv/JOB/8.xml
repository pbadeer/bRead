      <verse>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
</verse><verse>How long wilt thou speak these <supplied>things?</supplied> and <supplied>how long shall</supplied> the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
</verse><verse>Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
</verse><verse>If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
</verse><verse>If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
</verse><verse>If thou <supplied>wert</supplied> pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
</verse><verse>Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
</verse><verse>For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
</verse><verse>(For we <supplied>are but of</supplied> yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth <supplied>are</supplied> a shadow:)
</verse><verse>Shall not they teach thee, <supplied>and</supplied> tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
</verse><verse>Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
</verse><verse>Whilst it <supplied>is</supplied> yet in his greenness, <supplied>and</supplied> not cut down, it withereth before any <supplied>other</supplied> herb.
</verse><verse>So <supplied>are</supplied> the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:
</verse><verse>Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust <supplied>shall be</supplied> a spider’s web.
</verse><verse>He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
</verse><verse>He <supplied>is</supplied> green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
</verse><verse>His roots are wrapped about the heap, <supplied>and</supplied> seeth the place of stones.
</verse><verse>If he destroy him from his place, then <supplied>it</supplied> shall deny him, <supplied>saying,</supplied> I have not seen thee.
</verse><verse>Behold, this <supplied>is</supplied> the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
</verse><verse>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect <supplied>man,</supplied> neither will he help the evil doers:
</verse><verse>Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
</verse><verse>They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
