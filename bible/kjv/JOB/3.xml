      <verse>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
</verse><verse>And Job spake, and said,
</verse><verse>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <supplied>in which</supplied> it was said, There is a man child conceived.
</verse><verse>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
</verse><verse>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
</verse><verse>As <supplied>for</supplied> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
</verse><verse>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
</verse><verse>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
</verse><verse>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <supplied>have</supplied> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
</verse><verse>Because it shut not up the doors of my <supplied>mother&#x2019;s</supplied> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
</verse><verse>Why died I not from the womb? <supplied>why</supplied> did I <supplied>not</supplied> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
</verse><verse>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
</verse><verse>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
</verse><verse>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
</verse><verse>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
</verse><verse>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <supplied>which</supplied> never saw light.
</verse><verse>There the wicked cease <supplied>from</supplied> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
</verse><verse><supplied>There</supplied> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
</verse><verse>The small and great are there; and the servant <supplied>is</supplied> free from his master.
</verse><verse>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <supplied>in</supplied> soul;
</verse><verse>Which long for death, but it <supplied>cometh</supplied> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
</verse><verse>Which rejoice exceedingly, <supplied>and</supplied> are glad, when they can find the grave?
</verse><verse><supplied>Why is light given</supplied> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
</verse><verse>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
</verse><verse>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
</verse><verse>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
