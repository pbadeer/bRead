<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="JOB" n="40">
      <verse>Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
</verse><verse>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct <supplied>him?</supplied> he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
</verse><verse>Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
</verse><verse>Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
</verse><verse>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
</verse><verse>Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
</verse><verse>Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
</verse><verse>Deck thyself now <supplied>with</supplied> majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
</verse><verse>Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one <supplied>that is</supplied> proud, and abase him.
</verse><verse>Look on every one <supplied>that is</supplied> proud, <supplied>and</supplied> bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
</verse><verse>Hide them in the dust together; <supplied>and</supplied> bind their faces in secret.
</verse><verse>Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
</verse><verse>Lo now, his strength <supplied>is</supplied> in his loins, and his force <supplied>is</supplied> in the navel of his belly.
</verse><verse>He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
</verse><verse>His bones <supplied>are as</supplied> strong pieces of brass; his bones <supplied>are</supplied> like bars of iron.
</verse><verse>He <supplied>is</supplied> the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach <supplied>unto him. </supplied></verse><verse>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
</verse><verse>He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
</verse><verse>The shady trees cover him <supplied>with</supplied> their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
</verse><verse>Behold, he drinketh up a river, <supplied>and</supplied> hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
</verse><verse>He taketh it with his eyes: <supplied>his</supplied> nose pierceth through snares.
