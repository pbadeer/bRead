      <verse>Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> God liveth, <supplied>who</supplied> hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, <supplied>who</supplied> hath vexed my soul;
</verse><verse>All the while my breath <supplied>is</supplied> in me, and the spirit of God <supplied>is</supplied> in my nostrils;
</verse><verse>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
</verse><verse>God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
</verse><verse>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach <supplied>me</supplied> so long as I live.
</verse><verse>Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
</verse><verse>For what <supplied>is</supplied> the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
</verse><verse>Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
</verse><verse>Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
</verse><verse>I will teach you by the hand of God: <supplied>that</supplied> which <supplied>is</supplied> with the Almighty will I not conceal.
</verse><verse>Behold, all ye yourselves have seen <supplied>it;</supplied> why then are ye thus altogether vain?
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, <supplied>which</supplied> they shall receive of the Almighty.
</verse><verse>If his children be multiplied, <supplied>it is</supplied> for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
</verse><verse>Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
</verse><verse>Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
</verse><verse>He may prepare <supplied>it,</supplied> but the just shall put <supplied>it</supplied> on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
</verse><verse>He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth <supplied>that</supplied> the keeper maketh.
</verse><verse>The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he <supplied>is</supplied> not.
</verse><verse>Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
</verse><verse>The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>God</supplied> shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
</verse><verse><supplied>Men</supplied> shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
