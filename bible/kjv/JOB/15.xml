      <verse>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
</verse><verse>Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
</verse><verse>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
</verse><verse>Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
</verse><verse>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
</verse><verse>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
</verse><verse><supplied>Art</supplied> thou the first man <supplied>that</supplied> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
</verse><verse>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
</verse><verse>What knowest thou, that we know not? <supplied>what</supplied> understandest thou, which <supplied>is</supplied> not in us?
</verse><verse>With us <supplied>are</supplied> both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
</verse><verse><supplied>Are</supplied> the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
</verse><verse>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
</verse><verse>That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest <supplied>such</supplied> words go out of thy mouth?
</verse><verse>What <supplied>is</supplied> man, that he should be clean? and <supplied>he which is</supplied> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
</verse><verse>Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
</verse><verse>How much more abominable and filthy <supplied>is</supplied> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
</verse><verse>I will shew thee, hear me; and that <supplied>which</supplied> I have seen I will declare;
</verse><verse>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid <supplied>it: </supplied></verse><verse>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
</verse><verse>The wicked man travaileth with pain all <supplied>his</supplied> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
</verse><verse>A dreadful sound <supplied>is</supplied> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
</verse><verse>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
</verse><verse>He wandereth abroad for bread, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Where <supplied>is it?</supplied> he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
</verse><verse>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
</verse><verse>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
</verse><verse>He runneth upon him, <supplied>even</supplied> on <supplied>his</supplied> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
</verse><verse>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on <supplied>his</supplied> flanks.
</verse><verse>And he dwelleth in desolate cities, <supplied>and</supplied> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
</verse><verse>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
</verse><verse>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
</verse><verse>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
</verse><verse>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
</verse><verse>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
</verse><verse>For the congregation of hypocrites <supplied>shall be</supplied> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
</verse><verse>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
