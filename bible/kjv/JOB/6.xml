      <verse>But Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
</verse><verse>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
</verse><verse>For the arrows of the Almighty <supplied>are</supplied> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
</verse><verse>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
</verse><verse>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <supplied>any</supplied> taste in the white of an egg?
</verse><verse>The things <supplied>that</supplied> my soul refused to touch <supplied>are</supplied> as my sorrowful meat.
</verse><verse>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <supplied>me</supplied> the thing that I long for!
</verse><verse>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
</verse><verse>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
</verse><verse>What <supplied>is</supplied> my strength, that I should hope? and what <supplied>is</supplied> mine end, that I should prolong my life?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> my strength the strength of stones? or <supplied>is</supplied> my flesh of brass?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
</verse><verse>To him that is afflicted pity <supplied>should be shewed</supplied> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
</verse><verse>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, <supplied>and</supplied> as the stream of brooks they pass away;
</verse><verse>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, <supplied>and</supplied> wherein the snow is hid:
</verse><verse>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
</verse><verse>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
</verse><verse>The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
</verse><verse>They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
</verse><verse>For now ye are no thing; ye see <supplied>my</supplied> casting down, and are afraid.
</verse><verse>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
</verse><verse>Or, Deliver me from the enemy&#x2019;s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
</verse><verse>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
</verse><verse>How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
</verse><verse>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, <supplied>which are</supplied> as wind?
</verse><verse>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig <supplied>a pit</supplied> for your friend.
</verse><verse>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for <supplied>it is</supplied> evident unto you if I lie.
</verse><verse>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness <supplied>is</supplied> in it.
</verse><verse>Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
