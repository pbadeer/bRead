      <verse>But now <supplied>they that are</supplied> younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
</verse><verse>Yea, whereto <supplied>might</supplied> the strength of their hands <supplied>profit</supplied> me, in whom old age was perished?
</verse><verse>For want and famine <supplied>they were</supplied> solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
</verse><verse>Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots <supplied>for</supplied> their meat.
</verse><verse>They were driven forth from among <supplied>men,</supplied> (they cried after them as <supplied>after</supplied> a thief;)
</verse><verse>To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, <supplied>in</supplied> caves of the earth, and <supplied>in</supplied> the rocks.
</verse><verse>Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
</verse><verse><supplied>They were</supplied> children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
</verse><verse>And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
</verse><verse>They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
</verse><verse>Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
</verse><verse>Upon <supplied>my</supplied> right <supplied>hand</supplied> rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
</verse><verse>They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
</verse><verse>They came <supplied>upon me</supplied> as a wide breaking in <supplied>of waters:</supplied> in the desolation they rolled themselves <supplied>upon me. </supplied></verse><verse>Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
</verse><verse>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
</verse><verse>My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
</verse><verse>By the great force <supplied>of my disease</supplied> is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
</verse><verse>He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
</verse><verse>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me <supplied>not. </supplied></verse><verse>Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
</verse><verse>Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride <supplied>upon it,</supplied> and dissolvest my substance.
</verse><verse>For I know <supplied>that</supplied> thou wilt bring me <supplied>to</supplied> death, and <supplied>to</supplied> the house appointed for all living.
</verse><verse>Howbeit he will not stretch out <supplied>his</supplied> hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
</verse><verse>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was <supplied>not</supplied> my soul grieved for the poor?
</verse><verse>When I looked for good, then evil came <supplied>unto me:</supplied> and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
</verse><verse>My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
</verse><verse>I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, <supplied>and</supplied> I cried in the congregation.
</verse><verse>I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
</verse><verse>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
</verse><verse>My harp also is <supplied>turned</supplied> to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
