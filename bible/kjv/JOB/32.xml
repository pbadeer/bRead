<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Job" n="32" chapters="42">
      <verse>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he <supplied>was</supplied> righteous in his own eyes.
</verse><verse>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
</verse><verse>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
</verse><verse>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
</verse><verse>When Elihu saw that <supplied>there was</supplied> no answer in the mouth of <supplied>these</supplied> three men, then his wrath was kindled.
</verse><verse>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <supplied>am</supplied> young, and ye <supplied>are</supplied> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
</verse><verse>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
</verse><verse>But <supplied>there is</supplied> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
</verse><verse>Great men are not <supplied>always</supplied> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
</verse><verse>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
</verse><verse>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
</verse><verse>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <supplied>there was</supplied> none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
</verse><verse>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
</verse><verse>Now he hath not directed <supplied>his</supplied> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
</verse><verse>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
</verse><verse>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <supplied>and</supplied> answered no more;)
</verse><verse><supplied>I said,</supplied> I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
</verse><verse>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
</verse><verse>Behold, my belly <supplied>is</supplied> as wine <supplied>which</supplied> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
</verse><verse>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
</verse><verse>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man&#x2019;s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
</verse><verse>For I know not to give flattering titles; <supplied>in so doing</supplied> my maker would soon take me away.
