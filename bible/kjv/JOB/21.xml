<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="JOB" n="21">
      <verse>But Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
</verse><verse>Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
</verse><verse>As for me, <supplied>is</supplied> my complaint to man? and if <supplied>it were so,</supplied> why should not my spirit be troubled?
</verse><verse>Mark me, and be astonished, and lay <supplied>your</supplied> hand upon <supplied>your</supplied> mouth.
</verse><verse>Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
</verse><verse>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
</verse><verse>Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
</verse><verse>Their houses <supplied>are</supplied> safe from fear, neither <supplied>is</supplied> the rod of God upon them.
</verse><verse>Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
</verse><verse>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
</verse><verse>They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
</verse><verse>They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
</verse><verse>Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
</verse><verse>What <supplied>is</supplied> the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
</verse><verse>Lo, their good <supplied>is</supplied> not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
</verse><verse>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and <supplied>how oft</supplied> cometh their destruction upon them! <supplied>God</supplied> distributeth sorrows in his anger.
</verse><verse>They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
</verse><verse>God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
</verse><verse>For what pleasure <supplied>hath</supplied> he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
</verse><verse>Shall <supplied>any</supplied> teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
</verse><verse>One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
</verse><verse>His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
</verse><verse>And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
</verse><verse>They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
</verse><verse>Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices <supplied>which</supplied> ye wrongfully imagine against me.
</verse><verse>For ye say, Where <supplied>is</supplied> the house of the prince? and where <supplied>are</supplied> the dwelling places of the wicked?
</verse><verse>Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
</verse><verse>That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
</verse><verse>Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him <supplied>what</supplied> he hath done?
</verse><verse>Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
</verse><verse>The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as <supplied>there are</supplied> innumerable before him.
</verse><verse>How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
