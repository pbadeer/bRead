      <verse>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
</verse><verse><supplied>If</supplied> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
</verse><verse>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
</verse><verse>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
</verse><verse>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> not <supplied>this</supplied> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
</verse><verse>Remember, I pray thee, who <supplied>ever</supplied> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
</verse><verse>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
</verse><verse>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
</verse><verse>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
</verse><verse>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion&#x2019;s whelps are scattered abroad.
</verse><verse>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
</verse><verse>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
</verse><verse>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
</verse><verse>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
</verse><verse>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <supplied>was</supplied> before mine eyes, <supplied>there was</supplied> silence, and I heard a voice, <supplied>saying, </supplied></verse><verse>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his
maker?
</verse><verse>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
</verse><verse>How much less <supplied>in</supplied> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <supplied>is</supplied> in the dust, <supplied>which</supplied> are crushed before the moth?
</verse><verse>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Doth not their excellency <supplied>which is</supplied> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
