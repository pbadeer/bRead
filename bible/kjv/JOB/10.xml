      <verse>My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
</verse><verse>I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
</verse><verse><supplied>Is it</supplied> good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
</verse><verse>Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
</verse><verse><supplied>Are</supplied> thy days as the days of man? <supplied>are</supplied> thy years as man&#x2019;s days,
</verse><verse>That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
</verse><verse>Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and <supplied>there is</supplied> none that can deliver out of thine hand.
</verse><verse>Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
</verse><verse>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
</verse><verse>Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
</verse><verse>Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
</verse><verse>Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
</verse><verse>And these <supplied>things</supplied> hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this <supplied>is</supplied> with thee.
</verse><verse>If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
</verse><verse>If I be wicked, woe unto me; and <supplied>if</supplied> I be righteous, <supplied>yet</supplied> will I not lift up my head. <supplied>I am</supplied> full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
</verse><verse>For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
</verse><verse>Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war <supplied>are</supplied> against me.
</verse><verse>Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
</verse><verse>I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
</verse><verse><supplied>Are</supplied> not my days few? cease <supplied>then, and</supplied> let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
</verse><verse>Before I go <supplied>whence</supplied> I shall not return, <supplied>even</supplied> to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
</verse><verse>A land of darkness, as darkness <supplied>itself; and</supplied> of the shadow of death, without any order, and <supplied>where</supplied> the light <supplied>is</supplied> as darkness.
