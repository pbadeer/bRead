      <verse>Elihu spake moreover, and said,
</verse><verse>Thinkest thou this to be right, <supplied>that</supplied> thou saidst, My righteousness <supplied>is</supplied> more than Godâ€™s?
</verse><verse>For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? <supplied>and,</supplied> What profit shall I have, <supplied>if I be cleansed</supplied> from my sin?
</verse><verse>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
</verse><verse>Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds <supplied>which</supplied> are higher than thou.
</verse><verse>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or <supplied>if</supplied> thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
</verse><verse>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
</verse><verse>Thy wickedness <supplied>may hurt</supplied> a man as thou <supplied>art;</supplied> and thy righteousness <supplied>may profit</supplied> the son of man.
</verse><verse>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make <supplied>the oppressed</supplied> to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
</verse><verse>But none saith, Where <supplied>is</supplied> God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
</verse><verse>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
</verse><verse>There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
</verse><verse>Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
</verse><verse>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, <supplied>yet</supplied> judgment <supplied>is</supplied> before him; therefore trust thou in him.
</verse><verse>But now, because <supplied>it is</supplied> not <supplied>so,</supplied> he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth <supplied>it</supplied> not in great extremity:
</verse><verse>Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
