      <verse>But Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>How hast thou helped <supplied>him that is</supplied> without power? <supplied>how</supplied> savest thou the arm <supplied>that hath</supplied> no strength?
</verse><verse>How hast thou counseled <supplied>him that hath</supplied> no wisdom? and <supplied>how</supplied> hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
</verse><verse>To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
</verse><verse>Dead <supplied>things</supplied> are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
</verse><verse>Hell <supplied>is</supplied> naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
</verse><verse>He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, <supplied>and</supplied> hangeth the earth upon nothing.
</verse><verse>He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
</verse><verse>He holdeth back the face of his throne, <supplied>and</supplied> spreadeth his cloud upon it.
</verse><verse>He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
</verse><verse>The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
</verse><verse>He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
</verse><verse>By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
</verse><verse>Lo, these <supplied>are</supplied> parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
