      <verse>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
</verse><verse>For what portion of God <supplied>is there</supplied> from above? and <supplied>what</supplied> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is</supplied> not destruction to the wicked? and a strange <supplied>punishment</supplied> to the workers of iniquity?
</verse><verse>Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
</verse><verse>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
</verse><verse>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
</verse><verse>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
</verse><verse><supplied>Then</supplied> let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
</verse><verse>If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or <supplied>if</supplied> I have laid wait at my neighbour&#x2019;s door;
</verse><verse><supplied>Then</supplied> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
</verse><verse>For this <supplied>is</supplied> an heinous crime; yea, it <supplied>is</supplied> an iniquity <supplied>to be punished by</supplied> the judges.
</verse><verse>For it <supplied>is</supplied> a fire <supplied>that</supplied> consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
</verse><verse>If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
</verse><verse>What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
</verse><verse>Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
</verse><verse>If I have withheld the poor from <supplied>their</supplied> desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
</verse><verse>Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
</verse><verse>(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as <supplied>with</supplied> a father, and I have guided her from my mother&#x2019;s womb;)
</verse><verse>If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
</verse><verse>If his loins have not blessed me, and <supplied>if</supplied> he were <supplied>not</supplied> warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
</verse><verse>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
</verse><verse><supplied>Then</supplied> let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
</verse><verse>For destruction <supplied>from</supplied> God <supplied>was</supplied> a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
</verse><verse>If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, <supplied>Thou art</supplied> my confidence;
</verse><verse>If I rejoiced because my wealth <supplied>was</supplied> great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
</verse><verse>If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking <supplied>in</supplied> brightness;
</verse><verse>And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
</verse><verse>This also <supplied>were</supplied> an iniquity <supplied>to be punished by</supplied> the judge: for I should have denied the God <supplied>that is</supplied> above.
</verse><verse>If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
</verse><verse>Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
</verse><verse>If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
</verse><verse>The stranger did not lodge in the street: <supplied>but</supplied> I opened my doors to the traveller.
</verse><verse>If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
</verse><verse>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, <supplied>and</supplied> went not out of the door?
</verse><verse>Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire <supplied>is, that</supplied> the Almighty would answer me, and <supplied>that</supplied> mine adversary had written a book.
</verse><verse>Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, <supplied>and</supplied> bind it <supplied>as</supplied> a crown to me.
</verse><verse>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
</verse><verse>If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
</verse><verse>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
</verse><verse>Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
