      <verse>Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold <supplied>where</supplied> they fine <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass <supplied>is</supplied> molten <supplied>out of</supplied> the stone.
</verse><verse>He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
</verse><verse>The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; <supplied>even the waters</supplied> forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
</verse><verse><supplied>As for</supplied> the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
</verse><verse>The stones of it <supplied>are</supplied> the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:
</verse><verse>The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
</verse><verse>He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
</verse><verse>He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
</verse><verse>He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and <supplied>the thing that is</supplied> hid bringeth he forth to light.
</verse><verse>But where shall wisdom be found? and where <supplied>is</supplied> the place of understanding?
</verse><verse>Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
</verse><verse>The depth saith, It <supplied>is</supplied> not in me: and the sea saith, <supplied>It is</supplied> not with me.
</verse><verse>It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed <supplied>for</supplied> the price thereof.
</verse><verse>It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
</verse><verse>The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it <supplied>shall not be for</supplied> jewels of fine gold.
</verse><verse>No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> above rubies.
</verse><verse>The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
</verse><verse>Whence then cometh wisdom? and where <supplied>is</supplied> the place of understanding?
</verse><verse>Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
</verse><verse>Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
</verse><verse>God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
</verse><verse>For he looketh to the ends of the earth, <supplied>and</supplied> seeth under the whole heaven;
</verse><verse>To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
</verse><verse>When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
</verse><verse>Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
</verse><verse>And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <supplied>is</supplied> wisdom; and to depart from evil <supplied>is</supplied> understanding.
