      <verse>
      <supplied>Is there</supplied> not an appointed time to man upon earth? <supplied>are not</supplied> his days also like the days of an hireling?
</verse><verse>As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for <supplied>the reward of</supplied> his work:
</verse><verse>So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
</verse><verse>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
</verse><verse>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
</verse><verse>My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope.
</verse><verse>O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
</verse><verse>The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no <supplied>more:</supplied> thine eyes <supplied>are</supplied> upon me, and I <supplied>am</supplied> not.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no <supplied>more. </supplied></verse><verse>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
</verse><verse>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
</verse><verse><supplied>Am</supplied> I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
</verse><verse>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
</verse><verse>Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
</verse><verse>So that my soul chooseth strangling, <supplied>and</supplied> death rather than my life.
</verse><verse>I loathe <supplied>it;</supplied> I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days <supplied>are</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>What <supplied>is</supplied> man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
</verse><verse>And <supplied>that</supplied> thou shouldest visit him every morning, <supplied>and</supplied> try him every moment?
</verse><verse>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
</verse><verse>I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
</verse><verse>And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be.</supplied>
