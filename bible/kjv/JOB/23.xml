      <verse>Then Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>Even to day <supplied>is</supplied> my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
</verse><verse>Oh that I knew where I might find him! <supplied>that</supplied> I might come <supplied>even</supplied> to his seat!
</verse><verse>I would order <supplied>my</supplied> cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
</verse><verse>I would know the words <supplied>which</supplied> he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
</verse><verse>Will he plead against me with <supplied>his</supplied> great power? No; but he would put <supplied>strength</supplied> in me.
</verse><verse>There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
</verse><verse>Behold, I go forward, but he <supplied>is</supplied> not <supplied>there;</supplied> and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
</verse><verse>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <supplied>him:</supplied> he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <supplied>him: </supplied></verse><verse>But he knoweth the way that I take: <supplied>when</supplied> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
</verse><verse>My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
</verse><verse>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <supplied>food. </supplied></verse><verse>But he <supplied>is</supplied> in one <supplied>mind,</supplied> and who can turn him? and <supplied>what</supplied> his soul desireth, even
<supplied>that</supplied> he doeth.
</verse><verse>For he performeth <supplied>the thing that is</supplied> appointed for me: and many such <supplied>things are</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
</verse><verse>For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
</verse><verse>Because I was not cut off before the darkness, <supplied>neither</supplied> hath he covered the darkness from my face.
