      <verse>Lo, mine eye hath seen all <supplied>this,</supplied> mine ear hath heard and understood it.
</verse><verse>What ye know, <supplied>the same</supplied> do I know also: I <supplied>am</supplied> not inferior unto you.
</verse><verse>Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
</verse><verse>But ye <supplied>are</supplied> forgers of lies, ye <supplied>are</supplied> all physicians of no value.
</verse><verse>Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
</verse><verse>Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
</verse><verse>Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
</verse><verse>Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
</verse><verse>Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye <supplied>so</supplied> mock him?
</verse><verse>He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
</verse><verse>Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
</verse><verse>Your remembrances <supplied>are</supplied> like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
</verse><verse>Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what <supplied>will. </supplied></verse><verse>Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
</verse><verse>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
</verse><verse>He also <supplied>shall be</supplied> my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
</verse><verse>Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
</verse><verse>Behold now, I have ordered <supplied>my</supplied> cause; I know that I shall be justified.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> he <supplied>that</supplied> will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
</verse><verse>Only do not two <supplied>things</supplied> unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
</verse><verse>Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
</verse><verse>Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
</verse><verse>How many <supplied>are</supplied> mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
</verse><verse>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
</verse><verse>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
</verse><verse>For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
</verse><verse>Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
</verse><verse>And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
