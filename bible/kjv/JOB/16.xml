      <verse>Then Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>I have heard many such things: miserable comforters <supplied>are</supplied> ye all.
</verse><verse>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
</verse><verse>I also could speak as ye <supplied>do:</supplied> if your soul were in my soul&#x2019;s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
</verse><verse><supplied>But</supplied> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage <supplied>your grief. </supplied></verse><verse>Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and <supplied>though</supplied> I forbear, what am I eased?
</verse><verse>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
</verse><verse>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <supplied>which</supplied> is a witness <supplied>against me:</supplied> and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
</verse><verse>He teareth <supplied>me</supplied> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
</verse><verse>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
</verse><verse>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
</verse><verse>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken <supplied>me</supplied> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
</verse><verse>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
</verse><verse>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
</verse><verse>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
</verse><verse>My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;
</verse><verse>Not for <supplied>any</supplied> injustice in mine hands: also my prayer <supplied>is</supplied> pure.
</verse><verse>O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
</verse><verse>Also now, behold, my witness <supplied>is</supplied> in heaven, and my record <supplied>is</supplied> on high.
</verse><verse>My friends scorn me: <supplied>but</supplied> mine eye poureth out <supplied>tears</supplied> unto God.
</verse><verse>Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man <supplied>pleadeth</supplied> for his neighbour!
</verse><verse>When a few years are come, then I shall go the way <supplied>whence</supplied> I shall not return.
