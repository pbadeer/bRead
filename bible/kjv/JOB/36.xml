      <verse>Elihu also proceeded, and said,
</verse><verse>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that <supplied>I have</supplied> yet to speak on God&#x2019;s behalf.
</verse><verse>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
</verse><verse>For truly my words <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> false: he that is perfect in knowledge <supplied>is</supplied> with thee.
</verse><verse>Behold, God <supplied>is</supplied> mighty, and despiseth not <supplied>any: he is</supplied> mighty in strength <supplied>and</supplied> wisdom.
</verse><verse>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
</verse><verse>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings <supplied>are they</supplied> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
</verse><verse>And if <supplied>they be</supplied> bound in fetters, <supplied>and</supplied> be holden in cords of affliction;
</verse><verse>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
</verse><verse>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
</verse><verse>If they obey and serve <supplied>him,</supplied> they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
</verse><verse>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
</verse><verse>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
</verse><verse>They die in youth, and their life <supplied>is</supplied> among the unclean.
</verse><verse>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
</verse><verse>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <supplied>into</supplied> a broad place, where <supplied>there is</supplied> no straitness; and that which <supplied>should be</supplied> set on thy table should be full of fatness.
</verse><verse>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold <supplied>on thee. </supplied></verse><verse>Because <supplied>there is</supplied> wrath, <supplied>beware</supplied> lest he take thee away with <supplied>his</supplied> stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
</verse><verse>Will he esteem thy riches? <supplied>no,</supplied> not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
</verse><verse>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
</verse><verse>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
</verse><verse>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
</verse><verse>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
</verse><verse>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
</verse><verse>Every man may see it; man may behold <supplied>it</supplied> afar off.
</verse><verse>Behold, God <supplied>is</supplied> great, and we know <supplied>him</supplied> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
</verse><verse>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
</verse><verse>Which the clouds do drop <supplied>and</supplied> distil upon man abundantly.
</verse><verse>Also can <supplied>any</supplied> understand the spreadings of the clouds, <supplied>or</supplied> the noise of his tabernacle?
</verse><verse>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
</verse><verse>For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
</verse><verse>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it <supplied>not to shine</supplied> by <supplied>the cloud</supplied> that cometh betwixt.
</verse><verse>The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
