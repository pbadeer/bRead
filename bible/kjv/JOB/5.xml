      <verse>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
</verse><verse>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
</verse><verse>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
</verse><verse>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither <supplied>is there</supplied> any to deliver <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their
substance.
</verse><verse>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
</verse><verse>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
</verse><verse>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
</verse><verse>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
</verse><verse>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
</verse><verse>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
</verse><verse>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform <supplied>their</supplied> enterprise.
</verse><verse>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
</verse><verse>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
</verse><verse>But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
</verse><verse>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
</verse><verse>Behold, happy <supplied>is</supplied> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
</verse><verse>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
</verse><verse>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
</verse><verse>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
</verse><verse>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
</verse><verse>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle <supplied>shall be</supplied> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt know also that thy seed <supplied>shall be</supplied> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt come to <supplied>thy</supplied> grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
</verse><verse>Lo this, we have searched it, so it <supplied>is;</supplied> hear it, and know thou <supplied>it</supplied> for thy good.
