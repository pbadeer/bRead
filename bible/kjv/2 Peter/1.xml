      <verse>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
</verse><verse>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
</verse><verse>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <supplied>pertain</supplied> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
</verse><verse>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
</verse><verse>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
</verse><verse>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
</verse><verse>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
</verse><verse>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make <supplied>you that ye shall</supplied> neither <supplied>be</supplied> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
</verse><verse>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
</verse><verse>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <supplied>them,</supplied> and be established in the present truth.
</verse><verse>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <supplied>you</supplied> in remembrance;
</verse><verse>Knowing that shortly I must put off <supplied>this</supplied> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
</verse><verse>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
</verse><verse>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
</verse><verse>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</verse><verse>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
</verse><verse>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
</verse><verse>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
</verse><verse>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <supplied>as they were</supplied> moved by the Holy Ghost.
