      <verse>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
</verse><verse>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <supplied>so</supplied> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
</verse><verse>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
</verse><verse>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
</verse><verse>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
</verse><verse>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
</verse><verse>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here <supplied>am</supplied> I.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, Who <supplied>art</supplied> thou? And I answered him, I <supplied>am</supplied> an Amalekite.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <supplied>is</supplied> yet whole in me.
</verse><verse>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that <supplied>was</supplied> upon his head, and the bracelet that <supplied>was</supplied> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my
lord.
</verse><verse>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that <supplied>were</supplied> with him:
</verse><verse>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence <supplied>art</supplied> thou? And he answered, I <supplied>am</supplied> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
</verse><verse>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD&#x2019;S anointed?
</verse><verse>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, <supplied>and</supplied> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
</verse><verse>And David said unto him, Thy blood <supplied>be</supplied> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD&#x2019;S anointed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
</verse><verse>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <supplied>the use of</supplied> the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
</verse><verse>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
</verse><verse>Tell <supplied>it</supplied> not in Gath, publish <supplied>it</supplied> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
</verse><verse>Ye mountains of Gilboa, <supplied>let there be</supplied> no dew, neither <supplied>let there be</supplied> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <supplied>as though he had</supplied> not <supplied>been</supplied>
anointed with oil.
</verse><verse>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
</verse><verse>Saul and Jonathan <supplied>were</supplied> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
</verse><verse>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <supplied>other</supplied> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
</verse><verse>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, <supplied>thou wast</supplied> slain in thine high places.
</verse><verse>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
</verse><verse>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
