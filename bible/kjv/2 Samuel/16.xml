drink.
</verse><verse>And the king said, And where <supplied>is</supplied> thy master&#x2019;s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
</verse><verse>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine <supplied>are</supplied> all that <supplied>pertained</supplied> unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee <supplied>that</supplied> I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

      <verse>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
</verse><verse>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men <supplied>were</supplied> on his right hand and on his left.
</verse><verse>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
</verse><verse>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou <supplied>art taken</supplied> in thy mischief, because thou
<supplied>art</supplied> a bloody man.

      <verse>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
</verse><verse>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
</verse><verse>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now <supplied>may this</supplied> Benjamite <supplied>do it?</supplied> let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
</verse><verse>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
</verse><verse>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill&#x2019;s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
</verse><verse>And the king, and all the people that <supplied>were</supplied> with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David&#x2019;s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
</verse><verse>And Absalom said to Hushai, <supplied>Is</supplied> this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
</verse><verse>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
</verse><verse>And again, whom should I serve? <supplied>should I</supplied> not <supplied>serve</supplied> in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father&#x2019;s presence, so will I be in thy presence.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
</verse><verse>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father&#x2019;s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that <supplied>are</supplied> with thee be strong.
</verse><verse>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father&#x2019;s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
</verse><verse>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, <supplied>was</supplied> as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so <supplied>was</supplied> all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
