      <verse>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <supplied>and</supplied> giving of thanks, be made for all men;
</verse><verse>For kings, and <supplied>for</supplied> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
</verse><verse>For this <supplied>is</supplied> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
</verse><verse>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
</verse><verse>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
</verse><verse>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <supplied>and</supplied> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
</verse><verse>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
</verse><verse>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
</verse><verse>But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
</verse><verse>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
</verse><verse>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
</verse><verse>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
</verse><verse>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
</verse><verse>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
