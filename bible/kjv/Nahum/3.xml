      <verse>Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies <supplied>and</supplied> robbery; the prey departeth not;
</verse><verse>The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.
</verse><verse>The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and <supplied>there is</supplied> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and <supplied>there is</supplied> none end of <supplied>their</supplied> corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:
</verse><verse>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
</verse><verse>Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
</verse><verse>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
</verse><verse>Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, <supplied>that had</supplied> the waters round about it, whose rampart <supplied>was</supplied> the sea, <supplied>and</supplied> her wall <supplied>was</supplied> from the sea?
</verse><verse>Ethiopia and Egypt <supplied>were</supplied> her strength, and <supplied>it was</supplied> infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
</verse><verse>Yet <supplied>was</supplied> she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
</verse><verse>Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
</verse><verse>All thy strong holds <supplied>shall be like</supplied> fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.
</verse><verse>Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <supplied>are</supplied> women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.
</verse><verse>Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.
</verse><verse>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
</verse><verse>Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.
</verse><verse>Thy crowned <supplied>are</supplied> as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, <supplied>but</supplied> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they <supplied>are. </supplied></verse><verse>Thy
shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell <supplied>in the dust:</supplied> thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear
the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
