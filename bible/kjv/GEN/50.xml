      <verse>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
</verse><verse>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
</verse><verse>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
</verse><verse>And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
</verse><verse>My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
</verse><verse>And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
</verse><verse>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
</verse><verse>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which <supplied>is</supplied> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
</verse><verse>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This <supplied>is</supplied> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which <supplied>is</supplied> beyond Jordan.
</verse><verse>And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
</verse><verse>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
</verse><verse>And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
</verse><verse>So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
spake unto him.
</verse><verse>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we <supplied>be</supplied> thy servants.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for <supplied>am</supplied> I in the place of God?
</verse><verse>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; <supplied>but</supplied> God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as <supplied>it is</supplied> this day, to save much people alive.
</verse><verse>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
</verse><verse>And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third <supplied>generation:</supplied> the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
</verse><verse>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
</verse><verse>So Joseph died, <supplied>being</supplied> an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
