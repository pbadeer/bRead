      <verse>And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
</verse><verse>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This <supplied>is</supplied> God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
</verse><verse>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
</verse><verse>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
</verse><verse>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
</verse><verse>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <supplied>was</supplied> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
</verse><verse>And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
</verse><verse>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
</verse><verse>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, <supplied>and</supplied> the mother with the children.
</verse><verse>And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
</verse><verse>And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
</verse><verse>Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
</verse><verse>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
</verse><verse>And he delivered <supplied>them</supplied> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
</verse><verse>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose <supplied>art</supplied> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose <supplied>are</supplied> these before thee?
</verse><verse>Then thou shalt say, <supplied>They be</supplied> thy servant Jacob’s; it <supplied>is</supplied> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <supplied>is</supplied> behind us.
</verse><verse>And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
</verse><verse>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <supplied>is</supplied> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
</verse><verse>So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
</verse><verse>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
</verse><verse>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
</verse><verse>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
</verse><verse>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
</verse><verse>And he said unto him, What <supplied>is</supplied> thy name? And he said, Jacob.
</verse><verse>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
</verse><verse>And Jacob asked <supplied>him,</supplied> and said, Tell <supplied>me,</supplied> I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore <supplied>is</supplied> it <supplied>that</supplied> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
</verse><verse>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
</verse><verse>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
</verse><verse>Therefore the children of Israel eat not <supplied>of</supplied> the sinew which shrank, which <supplied>is</supplied> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.
