      <verse>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that <supplied>were</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>And all the king&#x2019;s servants, that <supplied>were</supplied> in the king&#x2019;s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did <supplied>him</supplied> reverence.
</verse><verse>Then the king&#x2019;s servants, which <supplied>were</supplied> in the king&#x2019;s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king&#x2019;s commandment?
</verse><verse>Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai&#x2019;s matters would stand: for he had told them that he <supplied>was</supplied> a Jew.
</verse><verse>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
</verse><verse>And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that <supplied>were</supplied> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, <supplied>even</supplied> the people of
Mordecai.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In the first month, that <supplied>is,</supplied> the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that <supplied>is,</supplied> the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, <supplied>to</supplied> the twelfth <supplied>month,</supplied> that <supplied>is,</supplied>
the month Adar.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws <supplied>are</supplied> diverse from all people; neither keep they the king&#x2019;s laws: therefore
it <supplied>is</supplied> not for the king&#x2019;s profit to suffer them.
</verse><verse>If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring <supplied>it</supplied> into the king&#x2019;s treasuries.
</verse><verse>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews&#x2019; enemy.
</verse><verse>And the king said unto Haman, The silver <supplied>is</supplied> given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
</verse><verse>Then were the king&#x2019;s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king&#x2019;s lieutenants, and to the governors that <supplied>were</supplied> over every province, and to the
rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and <supplied>to</supplied> every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king&#x2019;s ring.
</verse><verse>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king&#x2019;s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, <supplied>even</supplied> upon the thirteenth <supplied>day</supplied> of the twelfth
month, which <supplied>is</supplied> the month Adar, and <supplied>to take</supplied> the spoil of them for a prey.
</verse><verse>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
</verse><verse>The posts went out, being hastened by the king&#x2019;s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
