<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Esther" n="4" chapters="10">
      <verse>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
</verse><verse>And came even before the king&#x2019;s gate: for none <supplied>might</supplied> enter into the king&#x2019;s gate clothed with sackcloth.
</verse><verse>And in every province, whithersoever the king&#x2019;s commandment and his decree came, <supplied>there was</supplied> great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So Esther&#x2019;s maids and her chamberlains came and told <supplied>it</supplied> her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received <supplied>it</supplied> not.
</verse><verse>Then called Esther for Hatach, <supplied>one</supplied> of the king&#x2019;s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it <supplied>was,</supplied> and why it <supplied>was. </supplied></verse><verse>So Hatach went forth to Mordecai
unto the street of the city, which <supplied>was</supplied> before the king&#x2019;s gate.
</verse><verse>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king&#x2019;s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
</verse><verse>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew <supplied>it</supplied> unto Esther, and to declare <supplied>it</supplied> unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication
unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
</verse><verse>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
</verse><verse>All the king&#x2019;s servants, and the people of the king&#x2019;s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, <supplied>there is</supplied> one law of his to put <supplied>him</supplied> to death,
except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
</verse><verse>And they told to Mordecai Esther&#x2019;s words.
</verse><verse>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king&#x2019;s house, more than all the Jews.
</verse><verse>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, <supplied>then</supplied> shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father&#x2019;s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
kingdom for <supplied>such</supplied> a time as this?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Esther bade <supplied>them</supplied> return Mordecai <supplied>this answer, </supplied></verse><verse>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast
likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which <supplied>is</supplied> not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
</verse><verse>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
