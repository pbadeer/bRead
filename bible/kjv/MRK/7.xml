      <verse>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
</verse><verse>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash <supplied>their</supplied> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>when they come</supplied> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <supplied>as</supplied> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
</verse><verse>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
</verse><verse>He answered and said unto them, <jesus>Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <supplied>their</supplied> lips, but their heart is far from me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching
<supplied>for</supplied> doctrines the commandments of men. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, <supplied>as</supplied> the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them,
<jesus>Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But ye say, If a man shall
say to his father or mother, <supplied>It is</supplied> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <supplied>he shall be free. </supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

      <verse>And when he had called all the people <supplied>unto him,</supplied> he said unto them, <jesus>Hearken unto me every one <supplied>of you,</supplied> and understand: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the
things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </jesus></verse><verse>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
</verse><verse>And he saith unto them, <jesus>Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, <supplied>it</supplied> cannot defile him; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the
belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? </jesus></verse><verse>And he said, <jesus>That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,
murders, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

      <verse>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <supplied>it:</supplied> but he could not be hid.
</verse><verse>For a <supplied>certain</supplied> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
</verse><verse>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
</verse><verse>But Jesus said unto her, <jesus>Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast <supplied>it</supplied> unto the dogs. </jesus></verse><verse>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of
the children’s crumbs.
</verse><verse>And he said unto her, <jesus>For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. </jesus></verse><verse>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
</verse><verse>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
</verse><verse>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
</verse><verse>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, <jesus>Ephphatha,</jesus> that is, <jesus>Be opened. </jesus></verse><verse>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
</verse><verse>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <supplied>it; </supplied></verse><verse>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to
hear, and the dumb to speak.
