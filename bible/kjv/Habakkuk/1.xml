      <verse>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
</verse><verse>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <supplied>even</supplied> cry out unto thee <supplied>of</supplied> violence, and thou wilt not save!
</verse><verse>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <supplied>me</supplied> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <supplied>are</supplied> before me: and there are <supplied>that</supplied> raise up strife and contention.
</verse><verse>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <supplied>I</supplied> will work a work in your days, <supplied>which</supplied> ye will not believe, though it be told <supplied>you. </supplied></verse><verse>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <supplied>that</supplied> bitter and
hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <supplied>that are</supplied> not theirs.
</verse><verse>They <supplied>are</supplied> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
</verse><verse>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <supplied>that</supplied> hasteth to eat.
</verse><verse>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <supplied>as</supplied> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
</verse><verse>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.
</verse><verse>Then shall <supplied>his</supplied> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <supplied>imputing</supplied> this his power unto his god.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>Art</supplied> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
</verse><verse><supplied>Thou art</supplied> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <supplied>and</supplied> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <supplied>the man that is</supplied> more righteous than
he?
</verse><verse>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <supplied>that have</supplied> no ruler over them?
</verse><verse>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
</verse><verse>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <supplied>is</supplied> fat, and their meat plenteous.
</verse><verse>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
