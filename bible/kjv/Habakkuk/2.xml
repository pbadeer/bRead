      <verse>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
</verse><verse>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <supplied>it</supplied> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
</verse><verse>For the vision <supplied>is</supplied> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
</verse><verse>Behold, his soul <supplied>which</supplied> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <supplied>he is</supplied> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <supplied>is</supplied> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all
people:
</verse><verse>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <supplied>that which is</supplied> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
</verse><verse>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
</verse><verse>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men&#x2019;s blood, and <supplied>for</supplied> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
</verse><verse>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <supplied>against</supplied> thy soul.
</verse><verse>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!
</verse><verse>Behold, <supplied>is it</supplied> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?
</verse><verse>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <supplied>him,</supplied> and makest <supplied>him</supplied> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
</verse><verse>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD&#x2019;S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <supplied>shall be</supplied> on thy glory.
</verse><verse>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <supplied>which</supplied> made them afraid, because of men&#x2019;s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
</verse><verse>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <supplied>is</supplied> laid over with gold and silver, and <supplied>there is</supplied> no breath at all in the midst of it.
</verse><verse>But the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
