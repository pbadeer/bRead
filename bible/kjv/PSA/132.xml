      A Song of degrees.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, remember David, <supplied>and</supplied> all his afflictions:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How he sware unto the LORD, <supplied>and</supplied> vowed unto the mighty <supplied>God</supplied> of Jacob;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will not give sleep to mine eyes, <supplied>or</supplied> slumber to mine eyelids,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty <supplied>God</supplied> of Jacob.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thy servant Davidâ€™s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD hath sworn <supplied>in</supplied> truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired <supplied>it</supplied> for his habitation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
