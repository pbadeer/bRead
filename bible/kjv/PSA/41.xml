      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; <supplied>and</supplied> he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And if he come to see <supplied>me,</supplied> he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; <supplied>when</supplied> he goeth abroad, he telleth <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>An evil disease, <supplied>say they,</supplied> cleaveth fast unto him: and <supplied>now</supplied> that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up <supplied>his</supplied> heel against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
