      A Song <supplied>or</supplied> Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day <supplied>and</supplied> night before thee:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man <supplied>that hath</supplied> no strength:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <supplied>me</supplied> with all thy waves. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: <supplied>I am</supplied> shut up, and I cannot come forth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise <supplied>and</supplied> praise thee? Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <supplied>or</supplied> thy faithfulness in destruction?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <supplied>why</supplied> hidest thou thy face from me?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> afflicted and ready to die from <supplied>my</supplied> youth up: <supplied>while</supplied> I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, <supplied>and</supplied> mine acquaintance into darkness.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
