      A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, <supplied>and</supplied> in thy righteousness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul <supplied>thirsteth</supplied> after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Teach me to do thy will; for thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God: thy spirit <supplied>is</supplied> good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I <supplied>am</supplied> thy servant.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
