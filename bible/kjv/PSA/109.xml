      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my love they are my adversaries: but I <supplied>give myself unto</supplied> prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let his days be few; <supplied>and</supplied> let another take his office.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <supplied>their bread</supplied> also out of their desolate places.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let his posterity be cut off; <supplied>and</supplied> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let it be unto him as the garment <supplied>which</supplied> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Let</supplied> this <supplied>be</supplied> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake: because thy mercy <supplied>is</supplied> good, deliver thou me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I became also a reproach unto them: <supplied>when</supplied> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That they may know that this <supplied>is</supplied> thy hand; <supplied>that</supplied> thou, LORD, hast done it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <supplied>him</supplied> from those that condemn his soul.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
