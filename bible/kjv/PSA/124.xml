      A Song of degrees of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>If <supplied>it had not been</supplied> the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If <supplied>it had not been</supplied> the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD, who hath not given us <supplied>as</supplied> a prey to their teeth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our help <supplied>is</supplied> in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
