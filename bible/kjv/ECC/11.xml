      <verse>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.
</verse><verse>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
</verse><verse>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <supplied>themselves</supplied> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
</verse><verse>He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
</verse><verse>As thou knowest not what <supplied>is</supplied> the way of the spirit, <supplied>nor</supplied> how the bones <supplied>do grow</supplied> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
</verse><verse>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both <supplied>shall be</supplied> alike good.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Truly the light <supplied>is</supplied> sweet, and a pleasant <supplied>thing it is</supplied> for the eyes to behold the sun:
</verse><verse>But if a man live many years, <supplied>and</supplied> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these <supplied>things</supplied> God will bring thee into judgment.
</verse><verse>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth <supplied>are</supplied> vanity.
