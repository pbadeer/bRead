      <verse>A good name <supplied>is</supplied> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of oneâ€™s birth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>It is</supplied> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay <supplied>it</supplied> to his heart.
</verse><verse>Sorrow <supplied>is</supplied> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
</verse><verse>The heart of the wise <supplied>is</supplied> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <supplied>is</supplied> in the house of mirth.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
</verse><verse>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <supplied>is</supplied> the laughter of the fool: this also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
</verse><verse>Better <supplied>is</supplied> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <supplied>and</supplied> the patient in spirit <supplied>is</supplied> better than the proud in spirit.
</verse><verse>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
</verse><verse>Say not thou, What is <supplied>the cause</supplied> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> good with an inheritance: and <supplied>by it there is</supplied> profit to them that see the sun.
</verse><verse>For wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> a defence, <supplied>and</supplied> money <supplied>is</supplied> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <supplied>is, that</supplied> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
</verse><verse>Consider the work of God: for who can make <supplied>that</supplied> straight, which he hath made crooked?
</verse><verse>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
</verse><verse>All <supplied>things</supplied> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <supplied>man</supplied> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <supplied>man</supplied> that prolongeth <supplied>his life</supplied> in his wickedness.
</verse><verse>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
</verse><verse>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
</verse><verse>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <supplied>men</supplied> which are in the city.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
</verse><verse>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
</verse><verse>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <supplied>was</supplied> far from me.
</verse><verse>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
</verse><verse>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <supplied>of things,</supplied> and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <supplied>and</supplied> madness:
</verse><verse>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <supplied>is</supplied> snares and nets, <supplied>and</supplied> her hands <supplied>as</supplied> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
</verse><verse>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <supplied>counting</supplied> one by one, to find out the account:
</verse><verse>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
</verse><verse>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
