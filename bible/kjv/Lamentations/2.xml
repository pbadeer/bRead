      <verse>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <supplied>and</supplied> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
</verse><verse>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <supplied>them</supplied> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the
princes thereof.
</verse><verse>He hath cut off in <supplied>his</supplied> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <supplied>which</supplied> devoureth round about.
</verse><verse>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <supplied>that were</supplied> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
</verse><verse>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
</verse><verse>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <supplied>if it were of</supplied> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation
of his anger the king and the priest.
</verse><verse>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
</verse><verse>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
</verse><verse>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <supplied>are</supplied> among the Gentiles: the law <supplied>is</supplied> no <supplied>more;</supplied> her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
</verse><verse>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <supplied>and</supplied> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
</verse><verse>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
</verse><verse>They say to their mothers, Where <supplied>is</supplied> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers&#x2019; bosom.
</verse><verse>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
</verse><verse>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
</verse><verse>All that pass by clap <supplied>their</supplied> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <supplied>saying, Is</supplied> this the city that <supplied>men</supplied> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
</verse><verse>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <supplied>her</supplied> up: certainly this <supplied>is</supplied> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>The LORD
hath done <supplied>that</supplied> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <supplied>thine</supplied> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine
adversaries.
</verse><verse>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
</verse><verse>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <supplied>and</supplied> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
</verse><verse>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <supplied>them</supplied> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <supplied>and</supplied> not pitied.
</verse><verse>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD&#x2019;S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
