      <verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> the man <supplied>that</supplied> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
</verse><verse>He hath led me, and brought <supplied>me into</supplied> darkness, but not <supplied>into</supplied> light.
</verse><verse>Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand <supplied>against me</supplied> all the day.
</verse><verse>My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
</verse><verse>He hath builded against me, and compassed <supplied>me</supplied> with gall and travail.
</verse><verse>He hath set me in dark places, as <supplied>they that be</supplied> dead of old.
</verse><verse>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
</verse><verse>Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
</verse><verse>He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
</verse><verse>He <supplied>was</supplied> unto me <supplied>as</supplied> a bear lying in wait, <supplied>and as</supplied> a lion in secret places.
</verse><verse>He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
</verse><verse>He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
</verse><verse>He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
</verse><verse>I was a derision to all my people; <supplied>and</supplied> their song all the day.
</verse><verse>He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
</verse><verse>He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
</verse><verse>And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
</verse><verse>And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
</verse><verse>Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
</verse><verse>My soul hath <supplied>them</supplied> still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
</verse><verse>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

      <verse>
      <supplied>It is of</supplied> the LORD&#x2019;S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
</verse><verse><supplied>They are</supplied> new every morning: great <supplied>is</supplied> thy faithfulness.
</verse><verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
</verse><verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> good unto them that wait for him, to the soul <supplied>that</supplied> seeketh him.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> good that <supplied>a man</supplied> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
</verse><verse>He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
</verse><verse>He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
</verse><verse>He giveth <supplied>his</supplied> cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.
</verse><verse>For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
</verse><verse>But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
</verse><verse>For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
</verse><verse>To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
</verse><verse>To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
</verse><verse>To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> he <supplied>that</supplied> saith, and it cometh to pass, <supplied>when</supplied> the Lord commandeth <supplied>it</supplied> not?
</verse><verse>Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
</verse><verse>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
</verse><verse>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
</verse><verse>Let us lift up our heart with <supplied>our</supplied> hands unto God in the heavens.
</verse><verse>We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
</verse><verse>Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
</verse><verse>Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that <supplied>our</supplied> prayer should not pass through.
</verse><verse>Thou hast made us <supplied>as</supplied> the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
</verse><verse>All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
</verse><verse>Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
</verse><verse>Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
</verse><verse>Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
</verse><verse>Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
</verse><verse>Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
</verse><verse>Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
</verse><verse>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
</verse><verse>Waters flowed over mine head; <supplied>then</supplied> I said, I am cut off.
</verse><verse>I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
</verse><verse>Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
</verse><verse>Thou drewest near in the day <supplied>that</supplied> I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
</verse><verse>O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
</verse><verse>O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
</verse><verse>Thou hast seen all their vengeance <supplied>and</supplied> all their imaginations against me.
</verse><verse>Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, <supplied>and</supplied> all their imaginations against me;
</verse><verse>The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
</verse><verse>Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I <supplied>am</supplied> their musick.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
</verse><verse>Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
</verse><verse>Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
