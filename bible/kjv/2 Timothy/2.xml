      <verse>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
</verse><verse>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <supplied>this</supplied> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
</verse><verse>And if a man also strive for masteries, <supplied>yet</supplied> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
</verse><verse>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
</verse><verse>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
</verse><verse>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
</verse><verse>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <supplied>even</supplied> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
</verse><verse>Therefore I endure all things for the elect&#x2019;s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <supplied>him,</supplied> we shall also live with <supplied>him: </supplied></verse><verse>If we suffer, we shall also reign with <supplied>him:</supplied> if we deny <supplied>him,</supplied> he also will deny us:
</verse><verse>If we believe not, <supplied>yet</supplied> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
</verse><verse>Of these things put <supplied>them</supplied> in remembrance, charging <supplied>them</supplied> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <supplied>but</supplied> to the subverting of the hearers.
</verse><verse>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
</verse><verse>But shun profane <supplied>and</supplied> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
</verse><verse>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
</verse><verse>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
</verse><verse>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
</verse><verse>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master&#x2019;s use, <supplied>and</supplied> prepared unto every good work.
</verse><verse>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
</verse><verse>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
</verse><verse>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <supplied>men,</supplied> apt to teach, patient,
</verse><verse>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
</verse><verse>And <supplied>that</supplied> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
