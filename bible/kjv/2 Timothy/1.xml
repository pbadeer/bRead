      <verse>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
</verse><verse>To Timothy, <supplied>my</supplied> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <supplied>and</supplied> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
</verse><verse>I thank God, whom I serve from <supplied>my</supplied> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
</verse><verse>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
</verse><verse>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
</verse><verse>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
</verse><verse>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
</verse><verse>Who hath saved us, and called <supplied>us</supplied> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
</verse><verse>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
</verse><verse>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
</verse><verse>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
</verse><verse>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
</verse><verse>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
</verse><verse>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
</verse><verse>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <supplied>me. </supplied></verse><verse>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
