      To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The fool hath said in his heart, <supplied>There is</supplied> no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: <supplied>there is</supplied> none that doeth good.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were <supplied>any</supplied> that did understand, that did seek God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; <supplied>there is</supplied> none that doeth good, no, not one.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <supplied>as</supplied> they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There were they in great fear, <supplied>where</supplied> no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth <supplied>against</supplied> thee: thou hast put <supplied>them</supplied> to shame, because God hath despised them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that the salvation of Israel <supplied>were come</supplied> out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <supplied>and</supplied> Israel shall be glad.
