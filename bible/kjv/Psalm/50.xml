      A Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The mighty God, <supplied>even</supplied> the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God <supplied>is</supplied> judge himself. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I <supplied>am</supplied> God, <supplied>even</supplied> thy God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, <supplied>to have been</supplied> continually before me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will take no bullock out of thy house, <supplied>nor</supplied> he goats out of thy folds.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For every beast of the forest <supplied>is</supplied> mine, <supplied>and</supplied> the cattle upon a thousand hills.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field <supplied>are</supplied> mine.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world <supplied>is</supplied> mine, and the fulness thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or <supplied>that</supplied> thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou sittest <supplied>and</supplied> speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother&#x2019;s son.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>These <supplied>things</supplied> hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether <supplied>such an one</supplied> as thyself: <supplied>but</supplied> I will reprove thee, and set <supplied>them</supplied> in order before thine eyes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear <supplied>you</supplied> in pieces, and <supplied>there be</supplied> none to deliver.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth <supplied>his</supplied> conversation <supplied>aright</supplied> will I shew the salvation of God.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
