      A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hide not thy face from me in the day <supplied>when</supplied> I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day <supplied>when</supplied> I call answer me speedily.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <supplied>and</supplied> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My days <supplied>are</supplied> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt arise, <supplied>and</supplied> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <supplied>are</supplied> throughout all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens <supplied>are</supplied> the work of thy hands.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou <supplied>art</supplied> the same, and thy years shall have no end.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
