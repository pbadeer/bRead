      A Psalm <supplied>or</supplied> Song for the sabbath day.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is a</supplied> good <supplied>thing</supplied> to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD, how great are thy works! <supplied>and</supplied> thy thoughts are very deep.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; <supplied>it is</supplied> that they shall be destroyed for ever:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, LORD, <supplied>art most</supplied> high for evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But my horn shalt thou exalt like <supplied>the horn of</supplied> an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine eye also shall see <supplied>my desire</supplied> on mine enemies, <supplied>and</supplied> mine ears shall hear <supplied>my desire</supplied> of the wicked that rise up against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To shew that the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> upright: <supplied>he is</supplied> my rock, and <supplied>there is</supplied> no unrighteousness in him.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
