        <verse>Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine enemies would daily swallow <supplied>me</supplied> up: for <supplied>they be</supplied> many that fight against me, O thou most High.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts <supplied>are</supplied> against me for evil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shall they escape by iniquity? in <supplied>thine</supplied> anger cast down the people, O God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: <supplied>are they</supplied> not in thy book?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I cry <supplied>unto thee,</supplied> then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God <supplied>is</supplied> for me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In God will I praise <supplied>his</supplied> word: in the LORD will I praise <supplied>his</supplied> word.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy vows <supplied>are</supplied> upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
