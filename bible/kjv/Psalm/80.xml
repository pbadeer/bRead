        <verse>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest <supplied>between</supplied> the cherubims, shine forth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <supplied>and</supplied> save us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou preparedst <supplied>room</supplied> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <supplied>were like</supplied> the goodly cedars.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Why hast thou <supplied>then</supplied> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <supplied>that</supplied> thou madest strong for thyself.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is</supplied> burned with fire, <supplied>it is</supplied> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man <supplied>whom</supplied> thou madest strong for thyself.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
