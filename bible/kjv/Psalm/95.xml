        <verse>O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> a great God, and a great King above all gods.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In his hand <supplied>are</supplied> the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills <supplied>is</supplied> his also.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sea <supplied>is</supplied> his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry <supplied>land.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he <supplied>is</supplied> our God; and we <supplied>are</supplied> the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, <supplied>and as in</supplied> the day of temptation in the wilderness:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Forty years long was I grieved with <supplied>this</supplied> generation, and said, It <supplied>is</supplied> a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
