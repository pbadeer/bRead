      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; <supplied>therefore</supplied> I shall not slide.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thy lovingkindness <supplied>is</supplied> before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have hated the congregation of evildoers; and will not sit with the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In whose hands <supplied>is</supplied> mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
