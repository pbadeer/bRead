      A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou <supplied>art</supplied> God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For a thousand years in thy sight <supplied>are but</supplied> as yesterday when it is past, and <supplied>as</supplied> a watch in the night.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <supplied>as</supplied> a sleep: in the morning <supplied>they are</supplied> like grass <supplied>which</supplied> groweth up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret <supplied>sins</supplied> in the light of thy countenance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale <supplied>that is told.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The days of our years <supplied>are</supplied> threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength <supplied>they be</supplied> fourscore years, yet <supplied>is</supplied> their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, <supplied>so is</supplied> thy wrath.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So teach <supplied>us</supplied> to number our days, that we may apply <supplied>our</supplied> hearts unto wisdom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make us glad according to the days <supplied>wherein</supplied> thou hast afflicted us, <supplied>and</supplied> the years <supplied>wherein</supplied> we have seen evil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
