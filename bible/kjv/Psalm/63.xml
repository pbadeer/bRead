      A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O God, thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To see thy power and thy glory, so <supplied>as</supplied> I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because thy lovingkindness <supplied>is</supplied> better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My soul shall be satisfied as <supplied>with</supplied> marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise <supplied>thee</supplied> with joyful lips:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I remember thee upon my bed, <supplied>and</supplied> meditate on thee in the <supplied>night</supplied> watches.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But those <supplied>that</supplied> seek my soul, to destroy <supplied>it,</supplied> shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
