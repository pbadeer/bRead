      A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <supplied>are</supplied> they that rise up against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many <supplied>there be</supplied> which say of my soul, <supplied>There is</supplied> no help for him in God. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, O LORD, <supplied>art</supplied> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <supplied>themselves</supplied> against me round about.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <supplied>upon</supplied> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Salvation <supplied>belongeth</supplied> unto the LORD: thy blessing <supplied>is</supplied> upon thy people. Selah.
