      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which imagine mischiefs in <supplied>their</supplied> heart; continually are they gathered together <supplied>for</supplied> war.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders&#x2019; poison <supplied>is</supplied> under their lips. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I said unto the LORD, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; <supplied>lest</supplied> they exalt themselves. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>As for</supplied> the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow <supplied>him.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, <supplied>and</supplied> the right of the poor.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
