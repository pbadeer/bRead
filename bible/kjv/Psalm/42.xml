      To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where <supplied>is</supplied> thy God?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I remember these <supplied>things,</supplied> I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why <supplied>art</supplied> thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him <supplied>for</supplied> the help of his countenance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Yet</supplied> the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song <supplied>shall be</supplied> with me, <supplied>and</supplied> my prayer unto the God of my life.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>As</supplied> with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where <supplied>is</supplied> thy God?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, <supplied>who is</supplied> the health of my countenance, and my God.
