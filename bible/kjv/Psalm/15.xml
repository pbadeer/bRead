      A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>He that</supplied> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <supplied>He that</supplied> sweareth to <supplied>his own</supplied> hurt, and changeth not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>He that</supplied> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <supplied>things</supplied> shall never be moved.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
        </chapter>
