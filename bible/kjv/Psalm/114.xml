        <verse>When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Judah was his sanctuary, <supplied>and</supplied> Israel his dominion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sea saw <supplied>it,</supplied> and fled: Jordan was driven back.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The mountains skipped like rams, <supplied>and</supplied> the little hills like lambs.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>What <supplied>ailed</supplied> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, <supplied>that</supplied> thou wast driven back?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Ye mountains, <supplied>that</supplied> ye skipped like rams; <supplied>and</supplied> ye little hills, like lambs?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which turned the rock <supplied>into</supplied> a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
