      To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear this, all <supplied>ye</supplied> people; give ear, all <supplied>ye</supplied> inhabitants of the world:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart <supplied>shall be</supplied> of understanding.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <supplied>when</supplied> the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>None <supplied>of them</supplied> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>(For the redemption of their soul <supplied>is</supplied> precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That he should still live for ever, <supplied>and</supplied> not see corruption.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he seeth <supplied>that</supplied> wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their inward thought <supplied>is, that</supplied> their houses <supplied>shall continue</supplied> for ever, <supplied>and</supplied> their dwelling places to all generations; they call <supplied>their</supplied> lands after their own names.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Nevertheless man <supplied>being</supplied> in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts <supplied>that</supplied> perish.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>This their way <supplied>is</supplied> their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and <supplied>men</supplied> will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Man <supplied>that is</supplied> in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts <supplied>that</supplied> perish.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
