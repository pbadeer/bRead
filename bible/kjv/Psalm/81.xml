      To the chief Musician upon Gittith, a Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For this <supplied>was</supplied> a statute for Israel, <supplied>and</supplied> a law of the God of Jacob.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>This he ordained in Joseph <supplied>for</supplied> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <supplied>where</supplied> I heard a language <supplied>that</supplied> I understood not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So I gave them up unto their own hearts&#x2019; lust: <supplied>and</supplied> they walked in their own counsels.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <supplied>and</supplied> Israel had walked in my ways!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
