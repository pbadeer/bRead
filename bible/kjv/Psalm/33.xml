        </verse>
        <verse>Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery <supplied>and</supplied> an instrument of ten strings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the word of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> right; and all his works <supplied>are done</supplied> in truth.

        </verse>
        <verse>By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he spake, and it was <supplied>done;</supplied> he commanded, and it stood fast.

        </verse>
        <verse>The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the nation whose God <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD: <supplied>and</supplied> the people <supplied>whom</supplied> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>

        </verse>
        <verse>From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>An horse <supplied>is</supplied> a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver <supplied>any</supplied> by his great strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, the eye of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <supplied>is</supplied> our help and our shield.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
