        <verse>O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD our God: his judgments <supplied>are</supplied> in all the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <supplied>which</supplied> he commanded to a thousand generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which <supplied>covenant</supplied> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <supplied>and</supplied> to Israel <supplied>for</supplied> an everlasting covenant:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When they were <supplied>but</supplied> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When they went from one nation to another, from <supplied>one</supplied> kingdom to another people;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Saying,</supplied> Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent a man before them, <supplied>even</supplied> Joseph, <supplied>who</supplied> was sold for a servant:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The king sent and loosed him; <supplied>even</supplied> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent Moses his servant; <supplied>and</supplied> Aaron whom he had chosen.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <supplied>and</supplied> lice in all their coasts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He gave them hail for rain, <supplied>and</supplied> flaming fire in their land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <supplied>there was</supplied> not one feeble <supplied>person</supplied> among their tribes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>The people</supplied> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <supplied>like</supplied> a river.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he remembered his holy promise, <supplied>and</supplied> Abraham his servant.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he brought forth his people with joy, <supplied>and</supplied> his chosen with gladness:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
