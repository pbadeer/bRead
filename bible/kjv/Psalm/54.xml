      To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, God <supplied>is</supplied> mine helper: the Lord <supplied>is</supplied> with them that uphold my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <supplied>it is</supplied> good.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen <supplied>his desire</supplied> upon mine enemies.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
