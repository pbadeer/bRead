      To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned <supplied>thyself</supplied> from the fierceness of thine anger.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely his salvation <supplied>is</supplied> nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed <supplied>each other.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, the LORD shall give <supplied>that which is</supplied> good; and our land shall yield her increase.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set <supplied>us</supplied> in the way of his steps.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
