      To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct <supplied>my prayer</supplied> unto thee, and will look up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But as for me, I will come <supplied>into</supplied> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <supplied>and</supplied> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part <supplied>is</supplied> very wickedness; their throat <supplied>is</supplied> an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as <supplied>with</supplied> a shield.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
