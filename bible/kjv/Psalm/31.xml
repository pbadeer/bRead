      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name&#x2019;s sake lead me, and guide me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou <supplied>art</supplied> my strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <supplied>yea,</supplied> my soul and my belly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I have heard the slander of many: fear <supplied>was</supplied> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My times <supplied>are</supplied> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies&#x2019; sake.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, <supplied>and</supplied> let them be silent in the grave.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Oh</supplied> how great <supplied>is</supplied> thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O love the LORD, all ye his saints: <supplied>for</supplied> the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
