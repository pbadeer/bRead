      Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <supplied>it</supplied> in pieces, while <supplied>there is</supplied> none to deliver.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <supplied>it;</supplied> yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <supplied>to</supplied> the judgment <supplied>that</supplied> thou hast commanded.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <supplied>that is</supplied> in me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My defence <supplied>is</supplied> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <supplied>with the wicked</supplied> every day.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <supplied>which</supplied> he made.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
