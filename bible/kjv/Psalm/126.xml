      A Song of degrees.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD hath done great things for us; <supplied>whereof</supplied> we are glad.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <supplied>with him.</supplied>
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
