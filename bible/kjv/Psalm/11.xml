      To the chief Musician, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>In the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee <supplied>as</supplied> a bird to your mountain?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For, lo, the wicked bend <supplied>their</supplied> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> in his holy temple, the LORDâ€™S throne <supplied>is</supplied> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <supplied>this shall be</supplied> the portion of their cup.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
