      To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That thy beloved may be delivered; save <supplied>with</supplied> thy right hand, and hear me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Gilead <supplied>is</supplied> mine, and Manasseh <supplied>is</supplied> mine; Ephraim also <supplied>is</supplied> the strength of mine head; Judah <supplied>is</supplied> my lawgiver;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Moab <supplied>is</supplied> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who will bring me <supplied>into</supplied> the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Wilt</supplied> not thou, O God, <supplied>which</supplied> hadst cast us off? and <supplied>thou,</supplied> O God, <supplied>which</supplied> didst not go out with our armies?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Give us help from trouble: for vain <supplied>is</supplied> the help of man.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <supplied>it is that</supplied> shall tread down our enemies.
