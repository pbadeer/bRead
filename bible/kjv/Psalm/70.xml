      To the chief Musician, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, to bring to remembrance.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>
        <supplied>Make haste,</supplied> O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I <supplied>am</supplied> poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou <supplied>art</supplied> my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
