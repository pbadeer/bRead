        <verse>Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <supplied>that</supplied> is higher than I.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast been a shelter for me, <supplied>and</supplied> a strong tower from the enemy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given <supplied>me</supplied> the heritage of those that fear thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou wilt prolong the king&#x2019;s life: <supplied>and</supplied> his years as many generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, <supplied>which</supplied> may preserve him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
