      To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O LORD our Lord, how excellent <supplied>is</supplied> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <supplied>things</supplied> under his feet:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, <supplied>and whatsoever</supplied> passeth through the paths of the seas.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
