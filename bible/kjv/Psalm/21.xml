      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast given him his heart&#x2019;s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He asked life of thee, <supplied>and</supplied> thou gavest <supplied>it</supplied> him, <supplied>even</supplied> length of days for ever and ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His glory <supplied>is</supplied> great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, <supplied>which</supplied> they are not able <supplied>to perform.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, <supplied>when</supplied> thou shalt make ready <supplied>thine arrows</supplied> upon thy strings against the face of them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: <supplied>so</supplied> will we sing and praise thy power.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
