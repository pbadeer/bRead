      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Trust in the LORD, and do good; <supplied>so</supplied> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <supplied>it</supplied> to pass.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For yet a little while, and the wicked <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be:</supplied> yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, <supplied>and</supplied> to slay such as be of upright conversation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>A little that a righteous man hath <supplied>is</supplied> better than the riches of many wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <supplied>shall be</supplied> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For <supplied>such as be</supplied> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <supplied>they that be</supplied> cursed of him shall be cut off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The steps of a <supplied>good</supplied> man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth <supplied>him with</supplied> his hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have been young, and <supplied>now</supplied> am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>He is</supplied> ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed <supplied>is</supplied> blessed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The law of his God <supplied>is</supplied> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <supplied>was</supplied> not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mark the perfect <supplied>man,</supplied> and behold the upright: for the end of <supplied>that</supplied> man <supplied>is</supplied> peace.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the salvation of the righteous <supplied>is</supplied> of the LORD: <supplied>he is</supplied> their strength in the time of trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
