        <verse>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us <supplied>required of us</supplied> mirth, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Sing us <supplied>one</supplied> of the songs of Zion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How shall we sing the LORD&#x2019;S song in a strange land?

        <verse>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <supplied>her cunning.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

        <verse>Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <supplied>it,</supplied> rase <supplied>it, even</supplied> to the foundation thereof.

        </verse>
        <verse>Happy <supplied>shall he be,</supplied> that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
