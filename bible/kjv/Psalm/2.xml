        </verse>

        </verse>
        <verse>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.

        <verse>I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>

        <verse>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <supplied>from</supplied> the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <supplied>are</supplied> all they that put their trust in him.
