        <verse>O give thanks unto the LORD, for <supplied>he is</supplied> good: for his mercy <supplied>endureth</supplied> for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <supplied>and</supplied> he delivered them out of their distresses.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that <supplied>men</supplied> would praise the LORD <supplied>for</supplied> his goodness, and <supplied>for</supplied> his wonderful works to the children of men!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <supplied>being</supplied> bound in affliction and iron;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and <supplied>there was</supplied> none to help.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <supplied>and</supplied> he saved them out of their distresses.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that <supplied>men</supplied> would praise the LORD <supplied>for</supplied> his goodness, and <supplied>for</supplied> his wonderful works to the children of men!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <supplied>and</supplied> he saveth them out of their distresses.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <supplied>them</supplied> from their destructions.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that <supplied>men</supplied> would praise the LORD <supplied>for</supplied> his goodness, and <supplied>for</supplied> his wonderful works to the children of men!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit&#x2019;s end.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Oh that <supplied>men</supplied> would praise the LORD <supplied>for</supplied> his goodness, and <supplied>for</supplied> his wonderful works to the children of men!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <supplied>where there is</supplied> no way.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <supplied>him</supplied> families like a flock.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous shall see <supplied>it,</supplied> and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whoso <supplied>is</supplied> wise, and will observe these <supplied>things,</supplied> even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
