      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When the wicked, <supplied>even</supplied> mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this <supplied>will</supplied> I <supplied>be</supplied> confident.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>One <supplied>thing</supplied> have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear, O LORD, <supplied>when</supplied> I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>When thou saidst,</supplied> Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hide not thy face <supplied>far</supplied> from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>I had fainted,</supplied> unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
