      A Song of degrees.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But <supplied>there is</supplied> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My soul <supplied>waiteth</supplied> for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: <supplied>I say, more than</supplied> they that watch for the morning.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD <supplied>there is</supplied> mercy, and with him <supplied>is</supplied> plenteous redemption.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
