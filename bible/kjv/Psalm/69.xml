      To chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <supplied>my</supplied> soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I sink in deep mire, where <supplied>there is</supplied> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <supplied>being</supplied> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <supplied>that</supplied> which I took not away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother&#x2019;s children.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I wept, <supplied>and chastened</supplied> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <supplied>was</supplied> the song of the drunkards.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But as for me, my prayer <supplied>is</supplied> unto thee, O LORD, <supplied>in</supplied> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <supplied>is</supplied> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Draw nigh unto my soul, <supplied>and</supplied> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <supplied>are</supplied> all before thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <supplied>for some</supplied> to take pity, but <supplied>there was</supplied> none; and for comforters, but I found none.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let their table become a snare before them: and <supplied>that which should have been</supplied> for <supplied>their</supplied> welfare, <supplied>let it become</supplied> a trap.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let their habitation be desolate; <supplied>and</supplied> let none dwell in their tents.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they persecute <supplied>him</supplied> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I <supplied>am</supplied> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>This</supplied> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <supplied>or</supplied> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The humble shall see <supplied>this, and</supplied> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
