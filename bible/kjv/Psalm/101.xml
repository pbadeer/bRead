      A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; <supplied>it</supplied> shall not cleave to me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked <supplied>person.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine eyes <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
