        <verse>In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou <supplied>art</supplied> my rock and my fortress.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> my hope, O Lord GOD: <supplied>thou art</supplied> my trust from my youth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother&#x2019;s bowels: my praise <supplied>shall be</supplied> continually of thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am as a wonder unto many; but thou <supplied>art</supplied> my strong refuge.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let my mouth be filled <supplied>with</supplied> thy praise <supplied>and with</supplied> thy honour all the day.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for <supplied>there is</supplied> none to deliver <supplied>him.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be confounded <supplied>and</supplied> consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered <supplied>with</supplied> reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness <supplied>and</supplied> thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers <supplied>thereof.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, <supplied>even</supplied> of thine only.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto <supplied>this</supplied> generation, <supplied>and</supplied> thy power to every one <supplied>that</supplied> is to come.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy righteousness also, O God, <supplied>is</supplied> very high, who hast done great things: O God, who <supplied>is</supplied> like unto thee!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Thou,</supplied> which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will also praise thee with the psaltery, <supplied>even</supplied> thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
