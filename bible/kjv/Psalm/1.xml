        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But his delight <supplied>is</supplied> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The ungodly <supplied>are</supplied> not so: but <supplied>are</supplied> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
