      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Plead <supplied>my cause,</supplied> O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Draw out also the spear, and stop <supplied>the way</supplied> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <supplied>am</supplied> thy salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <supplied>them.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For without cause have they hid for me their net <supplied>in</supplied> a pit, <supplied>which</supplied> without cause they have digged for my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All my bones shall say, LORD, who <supplied>is</supplied> like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <supplied>things</supplied> that I knew not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They rewarded me evil for good <supplied>to</supplied> the spoiling of my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <supplied>was</supplied> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I behaved myself as though <supplied>he had been</supplied> my friend <supplied>or</supplied> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <supplied>for his</supplied> mother.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <supplied>yea,</supplied> the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew <supplied>it</supplied> not; they did tear <supplied>me,</supplied> and ceased not:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: <supplied>neither</supplied> let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against <supplied>them that are</supplied> quiet in the land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, <supplied>and</supplied> said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>This</supplied> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <supplied>even</supplied> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <supplied>themselves</supplied> against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness <supplied>and</supplied> of thy praise all the day long.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
