        <verse>How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <supplied>having</supplied> sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Consider <supplied>and</supplied> hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the <supplied>sleep of</supplied> death;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; <supplied>and</supplied> those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
