        <verse>Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh <supplied>but</supplied> in vain.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is</supplied> vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: <supplied>for</supplied> so he giveth his beloved sleep.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lo, children <supplied>are</supplied> an heritage of the LORD: <supplied>and</supplied> the fruit of the womb <supplied>is his</supplied> reward.
