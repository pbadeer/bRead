      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, <supplied>and</supplied> established my goings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, <supplied>even</supplied> praise unto our God: many shall see <supplied>it,</supplied> and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many, O LORD my God, <supplied>are</supplied> thy wonderful works <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast done, and thy thoughts <supplied>which are</supplied> to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: <supplied>if</supplied> I would declare and speak <supplied>of them,</supplied> they are more
than can be numbered.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book <supplied>it is</supplied> written of me,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law <supplied>is</supplied> within my heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I <supplied>am</supplied> poor and needy; <supplied>yet</supplied> the Lord thinketh upon me: thou <supplied>art</supplied> my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
