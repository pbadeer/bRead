      A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let my prayer be set forth before thee <supplied>as</supplied> incense; <supplied>and</supplied> the lifting up of my hands <supplied>as</supplied> the evening sacrifice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Incline not my heart to <supplied>any</supplied> evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the righteous smite me; <supplied>it shall be</supplied> a kindness: and let him reprove me; <supplied>it shall be</supplied> an excellent oil, <supplied>which</supplied> shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also <supplied>shall be</supplied> in their calamities.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our bones are scattered at the grave&#x2019;s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth <supplied>wood</supplied> upon the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But mine eyes <supplied>are</supplied> unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Keep me from the snares <supplied>which</supplied> they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
