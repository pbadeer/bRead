      A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>There is</supplied> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <supplied>is there any</supplied> rest in my bones because of my sin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My wounds stink <supplied>and</supplied> are corrupt because of my foolishness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my loins are filled with a loathsome <supplied>disease:</supplied> and <supplied>there is</supplied> no soundness in my flesh.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lord, all my desire <supplied>is</supplied> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They also that seek after my life lay snares <supplied>for me:</supplied> and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I, as a deaf <supplied>man,</supplied> heard not; and <supplied>I was</supplied> as a dumb man <supplied>that</supplied> openeth not his mouth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <supplied>are</supplied> no reproofs.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I said, <supplied>Hear me,</supplied> lest <supplied>otherwise</supplied> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <supplied>themselves</supplied> against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> ready to halt, and my sorrow <supplied>is</supplied> continually before me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But mine enemies <supplied>are</supplied> lively, <supplied>and</supplied> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <supplied>the thing that</supplied> good <supplied>is.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
