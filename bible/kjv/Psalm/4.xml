      To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <supplied>when I was</supplied> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O ye sons of men, how long <supplied>will ye turn</supplied> my glory into shame? <supplied>how long</supplied> will ye love vanity, <supplied>and</supplied> seek after leasing? Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>There be</supplied> many that say, Who will shew us <supplied>any</supplied> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <supplied>that</supplied> their corn and their wine increased.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
