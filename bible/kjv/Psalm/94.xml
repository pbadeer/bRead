        <verse>O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>How long</supplied> shall they utter <supplied>and</supplied> speak hard things? <supplied>and</supplied> all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Understand, ye brutish among the people: and <supplied>ye</supplied> fools, when will ye be wise?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, <supplied>shall not he know?</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they <supplied>are</supplied> vanity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? <supplied>or</supplied> who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Unless the LORD <supplied>had been</supplied> my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the LORD is my defence; and my God <supplied>is</supplied> the rock of my refuge.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; <supplied>yea,</supplied> the LORD our God shall cut them off.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
