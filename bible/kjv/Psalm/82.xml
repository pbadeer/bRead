      A Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver the poor and needy: rid <supplied>them</supplied> out of the hand of the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have said, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> gods; and all of you <supplied>are</supplied> children of the most High.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
