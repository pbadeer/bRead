      To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <supplied>why art thou so</supplied> far from helping me, <supplied>and from</supplied> the words of my roaring?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou <supplied>art</supplied> holy, <supplied>O thou</supplied> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I <supplied>am</supplied> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head <supplied>saying,</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He trusted on the LORD <supplied>that</supplied> he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou <supplied>art</supplied> he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope <supplied>when I was</supplied> upon my mother&#x2019;s breasts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God from my mother&#x2019;s belly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be not far from me; for trouble <supplied>is</supplied> near; for <supplied>there is</supplied> none to help.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many bulls have compassed me: strong <supplied>bulls</supplied> of Bashan have beset me round.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They gaped upon me <supplied>with</supplied> their mouths, <supplied>as</supplied> a ravening and a roaring lion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I may tell all my bones: they look <supplied>and</supplied> stare upon me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Save me from the lion&#x2019;s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My praise <supplied>shall be</supplied> of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the kingdom <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD&#x2019;S: and he <supplied>is</supplied> the governor among the nations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All <supplied>they that be</supplied> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done <supplied>this.</supplied>
