      To the chief Musician, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <supplied>that</supplied> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he
said,
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <supplied>and</supplied> my high tower.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will call upon the LORD, <supplied>who is worthy</supplied> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <supplied>even</supplied> into his ears.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <supplied>was</supplied> under his feet.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <supplied>were</supplied> dark waters <supplied>and</supplied> thick clouds of the skies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>At the brightness <supplied>that was</supplied> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <supplied>stones</supplied> and coals of fire.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <supplied>stones</supplied> and coals of fire.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For all his judgments <supplied>were</supplied> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>As for</supplied> God, his way <supplied>is</supplied> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <supplied>is</supplied> a buckler to all those that trust in him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For who <supplied>is</supplied> God save the LORD? or who <supplied>is</supplied> a rock save our God?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is</supplied> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He maketh my feet like hinds&#x2019; <supplied>feet,</supplied> and setteth me upon my high places.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They cried, but <supplied>there was</supplied> none to save <supplied>them: even</supplied> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <supplied>and</supplied> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <supplied>whom</supplied> I have not known shall serve me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD liveth; and blessed <supplied>be</supplied> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is</supplied> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
