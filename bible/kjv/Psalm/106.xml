        <verse>Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for <supplied>he is</supplied> good: for his mercy <supplied>endureth</supplied> for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <supplied>who</supplied> can shew forth all his praise?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>are</supplied> they that keep judgment, <supplied>and</supplied> he that doeth righteousness at all times.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <supplied>that thou bearest unto</supplied> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <supplied>him</supplied> at the sea, <supplied>even</supplied> at the Red sea.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Nevertheless he saved them for his name&#x2019;s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <supplied>them,</supplied> and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They envied Moses also in the camp, <supplied>and</supplied> Aaron the saint of the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <supplied>and</supplied> terrible things by the Red sea.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <supplied>them.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But murmured in their tents, <supplied>and</supplied> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thus they provoked <supplied>him</supplied> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <supplied>so</supplied> the plague was stayed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They angered <supplied>him</supplied> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And shed innocent blood, <supplied>even</supplied> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <supplied>him</supplied> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <supplied>and</supplied> to triumph in thy praise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
