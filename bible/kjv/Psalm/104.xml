        <verse>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who coverest <supplied>thyself</supplied> with light as <supplied>with</supplied> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Who</supplied> laid the foundations of the earth, <supplied>that</supplied> it should not be removed for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou coveredst it with the deep as <supplied>with</supplied> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <supplied>which</supplied> run among the hills.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <supplied>which</supplied> sing among the branches.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And wine <supplied>that</supplied> maketh glad the heart of man, <supplied>and</supplied> oil to make <supplied>his</supplied> face to shine, and bread <supplied>which</supplied> strengtheneth manâ€™s heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The trees of the LORD are full <supplied>of sap;</supplied> the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Where the birds make their nests: <supplied>as for</supplied> the stork, the fir trees <supplied>are</supplied> her house.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The high hills <supplied>are</supplied> a refuge for the wild goats; <supplied>and</supplied> the rocks for the conies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <supplied>forth.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>So is</supplied> this great and wide sea, wherein <supplied>are</supplied> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There go the ships: <supplied>there is</supplied> that leviathan, <supplied>whom</supplied> thou hast made to play therein.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <supplied>them</supplied> their meat in due season.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>That</supplied> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
