      A Prayer of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I <supplied>am</supplied> poor and needy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Preserve my soul; for I <supplied>am</supplied> holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou, Lord, <supplied>art</supplied> good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Among the gods <supplied>there is</supplied> none like unto thee, O Lord; neither <supplied>are there any works</supplied> like unto thy works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> great, and doest wondrous things: thou <supplied>art</supplied> God alone.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For great <supplied>is</supplied> thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent <supplied>men</supplied> have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, O Lord, <supplied>art</supplied> a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see <supplied>it,</supplied> and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast helped me, and comforted me.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
