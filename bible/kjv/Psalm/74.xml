      Maschil of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? <supplied>why</supplied> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember thy congregation, <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <supplied>even</supplied> all <supplied>that</supplied> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns <supplied>for</supplied> signs.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>A man</supplied> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <supplied>by casting down</supplied> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We see not our signs: <supplied>there is</supplied> no more any prophet: neither <supplied>is there</supplied> among us any that knoweth how long.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck <supplied>it</supplied> out of thy bosom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For God <supplied>is</supplied> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, <supplied>and</supplied> gavest him <supplied>to be</supplied> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The day <supplied>is</supplied> thine, the night also <supplied>is</supplied> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember this, <supplied>that</supplied> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and <supplied>that</supplied> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude <supplied>of the wicked:</supplied> forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
