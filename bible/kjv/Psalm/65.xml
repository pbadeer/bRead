        <verse>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Iniquities prevail against me: <supplied>as for</supplied> our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is the man whom</supplied> thou choosest, and causest to approach <supplied>unto thee, that</supplied> he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, <supplied>even</supplied> of thy holy temple.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; <supplied>who art</supplied> the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off <supplied>upon</supplied> the sea:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; <supplied>being</supplied> girded with power:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, <supplied>which</supplied> is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They drop <supplied>upon</supplied> the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
