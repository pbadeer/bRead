        <verse>Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, <supplied>who is</supplied> the health of my countenance, and my God.
