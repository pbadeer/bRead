      A Song <supplied>or</supplied> Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <supplied>being</supplied> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Do unto them as <supplied>unto</supplied> the Midianites; as <supplied>to</supplied> Sisera, as <supplied>to</supplied> Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Which</supplied> perished at Endor: they became <supplied>as</supplied> dung for the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That <supplied>men</supplied> may know that thou, whose name alone <supplied>is</supplied> JEHOVAH, <supplied>art</supplied> the most high over all the earth.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
