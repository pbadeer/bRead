      To the chief Musician, <supplied>even</supplied> to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, <supplied>even</supplied> from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: <supplied>then</supplied> spake I with my tongue,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it <supplied>is; that</supplied> I may know how frail I <supplied>am.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, thou hast made my days <supplied>as</supplied> an handbreadth; and mine age <supplied>is</supplied> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state <supplied>is</supplied> altogether vanity. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <supplied>riches,</supplied> and knoweth not who shall gather them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope <supplied>is</supplied> in thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man <supplied>is</supplied> vanity. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I <supplied>am</supplied> a stranger with thee, <supplied>and</supplied> a sojourner, as all my fathers <supplied>were.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
