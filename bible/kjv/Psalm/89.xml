      Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? <supplied>who</supplied> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all <supplied>them that are</supplied> about him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD God of hosts, who <supplied>is</supplied> a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The heavens <supplied>are</supplied> thine, the earth also <supplied>is</supplied> thine: <supplied>as for</supplied> the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, <supplied>and</supplied> high is thy right hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Justice and judgment <supplied>are</supplied> the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> our defence; and the Holy One of Israel <supplied>is</supplied> our king.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon <supplied>one that is</supplied> mighty; I have exalted <supplied>one</supplied> chosen out of the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But my faithfulness and my mercy <supplied>shall be</supplied> with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall cry unto me, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Also I will make him <supplied>my</supplied> firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His seed also will I make <supplied>to endure</supplied> for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <supplied>as</supplied> a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown <supplied>by casting it</supplied> to the ground.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>What man <supplied>is he that</supplied> liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lord, where <supplied>are</supplied> thy former lovingkindnesses, <supplied>which</supplied> thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <supplied>how</supplied> I do bear in my bosom <supplied>the reproach of</supplied> all the mighty people;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
