      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known <supplied>me.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted <supplied>with</supplied> all my ways.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> not a word in my tongue, <supplied>but,</supplied> lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Such</supplied> knowledge <supplied>is</supplied> too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot <supplied>attain</supplied> unto it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I ascend up into heaven, thou <supplied>art</supplied> there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou <supplied>art there.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>If</supplied> I take the wings of the morning, <supplied>and</supplied> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light <supplied>are</supplied> both alike <supplied>to thee.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother&#x2019;s womb.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully <supplied>and</supplied> wonderfully made: marvellous <supplied>are</supplied> thy works; and <supplied>that</supplied> my soul knoweth right well.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, <supplied>and</supplied> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all <supplied>my members</supplied> were written, <supplied>which</supplied> in continuance were fashioned, when <supplied>as yet there was</supplied> none of them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>If</supplied> I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they speak against thee wickedly, <supplied>and</supplied> thine enemies take <supplied>thy name</supplied> in vain.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And see if <supplied>there be any</supplied> wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
