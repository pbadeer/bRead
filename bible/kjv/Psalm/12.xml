      To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <supplied>with</supplied> flattering lips <supplied>and</supplied> with a double heart do they speak.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, <supplied>and</supplied> the tongue that speaketh proud things:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips <supplied>are</supplied> our own: who <supplied>is</supplied> lord over us?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set <supplied>him</supplied> in safety <supplied>from him that</supplied> puffeth at him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The words of the LORD <supplied>are</supplied> pure words: <supplied>as</supplied> silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
