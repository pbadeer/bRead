      A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my shepherd; I shall not want.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#x2019;s sake.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou <supplied>art</supplied> with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
