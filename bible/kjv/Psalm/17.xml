      A Prayer of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, <supplied>that goeth</supplied> not out of feigned lips.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <supplied>me</supplied> in the night; thou hast tried me, <supplied>and</supplied> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <supplied>that</supplied> my mouth shall not transgress.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <supplied>me from</supplied> the paths of the destroyer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hold up my goings in thy paths, <supplied>that</supplied> my footsteps slip not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <supplied>and hear</supplied> my speech.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust <supplied>in thee</supplied> from those that rise up <supplied>against them.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>From the wicked that oppress me, <supplied>from</supplied> my deadly enemies, <supplied>who</supplied> compass me about.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Like as a lion <supplied>that</supplied> is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, <supplied>which is</supplied> thy sword:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>From men <supplied>which are</supplied> thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <supplied>which have</supplied> their portion in <supplied>this</supplied> life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid <supplied>treasure:</supplied> they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
<supplied>substance</supplied> to their babes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
