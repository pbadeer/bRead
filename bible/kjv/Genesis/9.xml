      <verse>And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
</verse><verse>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <supplied>upon</supplied> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
</verse><verse>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
</verse><verse>But flesh with the life thereof, <supplied>which is</supplied> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
</verse><verse>And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.
</verse><verse>Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
</verse><verse>And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

      <verse>And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
</verse><verse>And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
</verse><verse>And with every living creature that <supplied>is</supplied> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
</verse><verse>And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
</verse><verse>And God said, This <supplied>is</supplied> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that <supplied>is</supplied> with you, for perpetual generations:
</verse><verse>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
</verse><verse>And I will remember my covenant, which <supplied>is</supplied> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
</verse><verse>And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <supplied>is</supplied> upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And God said unto Noah, This <supplied>is</supplied> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that <supplied>is</supplied> upon the earth.

      <verse>And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
</verse><verse>These <supplied>are</supplied> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
</verse><verse>And Noah began <supplied>to be</supplied> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
</verse><verse>And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
</verse><verse>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
</verse><verse>And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid <supplied>it</supplied> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces <supplied>were</supplied> backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
</verse><verse>And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
</verse><verse>And he said, Cursed <supplied>be</supplied> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
</verse><verse>And he said, Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
</verse><verse>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
