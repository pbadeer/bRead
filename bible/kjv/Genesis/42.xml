      <verse>Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
</verse><verse>And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph&#x2019;s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
</verse><verse>But Benjamin, Joseph&#x2019;s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
</verse><verse>And the sons of Israel came to buy <supplied>corn</supplied> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
</verse><verse>And Joseph <supplied>was</supplied> the governor over the land, <supplied>and</supplied> he <supplied>it was</supplied> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph&#x2019;s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him <supplied>with</supplied> their faces to the earth.
</verse><verse>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
</verse><verse>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
</verse><verse>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
</verse><verse>And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
</verse><verse>We <supplied>are</supplied> all one man&#x2019;s sons; we <supplied>are</supplied> true <supplied>men,</supplied> thy servants are no spies.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
</verse><verse>And they said, Thy servants <supplied>are</supplied> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest <supplied>is</supplied> this day with our father, and one <supplied>is</supplied> not.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto them, That <supplied>is it</supplied> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> spies:
</verse><verse>Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
</verse><verse>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <supplied>there be any</supplied> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <supplied>are</supplied> spies.
</verse><verse>And he put them all together into ward three days.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; <supplied>for</supplied> I fear God:
</verse><verse>If ye <supplied>be</supplied> true <supplied>men,</supplied> let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
</verse><verse>But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they said one to another, We <supplied>are</supplied> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
</verse><verse>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
</verse><verse>And they knew not that Joseph understood <supplied>them;</supplied> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
</verse><verse>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man&#x2019;s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
</verse><verse>And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
</verse><verse>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it <supplied>was</supplied> in his sack&#x2019;s mouth.
</verse><verse>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <supplied>it is</supplied> even in my sack: and their heart failed <supplied>them,</supplied> and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <supplied>is</supplied> this <supplied>that</supplied> God hath done unto us?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
</verse><verse>The man, <supplied>who is</supplied> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
</verse><verse>And we said unto him, We <supplied>are</supplied> true <supplied>men;</supplied> we are no spies:
</verse><verse>We <supplied>be</supplied> twelve brethren, sons of our father; one <supplied>is</supplied> not, and the youngest <supplied>is</supplied> this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
</verse><verse>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye <supplied>are</supplied> true <supplied>men;</supplied> leave one of your brethren <supplied>here</supplied> with me, and take <supplied>food for</supplied> the famine of your households, and be gone:
</verse><verse>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye <supplied>are</supplied> no spies, but <supplied>that</supplied> ye <supplied>are</supplied> true <supplied>men: so</supplied> will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man&#x2019;s bundle of money <supplied>was</supplied> in his sack: and when <supplied>both</supplied> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
</verse><verse>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <supplied>of my children:</supplied> Joseph <supplied>is</supplied> not, and Simeon <supplied>is</supplied> not, and ye will take Benjamin <supplied>away:</supplied> all these things are against me.
</verse><verse>And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
</verse><verse>And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
