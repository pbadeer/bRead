</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
</verse><verse>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <supplied>shall be</supplied> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

</verse><verse>And now <supplied>art</supplied> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother&#x2019;s blood from thy hand;
</verse><verse>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
</verse><verse>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <supplied>is</supplied> greater than I can bear.
</verse><verse>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> every one that findeth me shall slay me.
