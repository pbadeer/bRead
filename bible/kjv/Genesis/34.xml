      <verse>And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
</verse><verse>And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
</verse><verse>And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
</verse><verse>And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
</verse><verse>And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
</verse><verse>And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard <supplied>it:</supplied> and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob&#x2019;s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
</verse><verse>And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
</verse><verse>And make ye marriages with us, <supplied>and</supplied> give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
</verse><verse>And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
</verse><verse>And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
</verse><verse>Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
</verse><verse>And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
</verse><verse>And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that <supplied>were</supplied> a reproach unto us:
</verse><verse>But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we <supplied>be,</supplied> that every male of you be circumcised;
</verse><verse>Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
</verse><verse>But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
</verse><verse>And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor&#x2019;s son.
</verse><verse>And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob&#x2019;s daughter: and he <supplied>was</supplied> more honourable than all the house of his father.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
</verse><verse>These men <supplied>are</supplied> peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, <supplied>it is</supplied> large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
</verse><verse>Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they <supplied>are</supplied> circumcised.
</verse><verse><supplied>Shall</supplied> not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs <supplied>be</supplied> ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
</verse><verse>And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&#x2019;s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
</verse><verse>And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem&#x2019;s house, and went out.
</verse><verse>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
</verse><verse>They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which <supplied>was</supplied> in the city, and that which <supplied>was</supplied> in the field,
</verse><verse>And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that <supplied>was</supplied> in the house.
</verse><verse>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I <supplied>being</supplied> few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and
slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
</verse><verse>And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
