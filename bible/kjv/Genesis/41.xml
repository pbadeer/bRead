      <verse>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
</verse><verse>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
</verse><verse>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <supplied>other</supplied> kine upon the brink of the river.
</verse><verse>And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
</verse><verse>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
</verse><verse>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
</verse><verse>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <supplied>it was</supplied> a dream.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <supplied>there was</supplied> none that could interpret them unto
Pharaoh.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
</verse><verse>Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard&#x2019;s house, both <supplied>me</supplied> and the chief baker:
</verse><verse>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>there was</supplied> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <supplied>himself,</supplied> and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <supplied>there is</supplied> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <supplied>that</supplied> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
</verse><verse>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <supplied>It is</supplied> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
</verse><verse>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
</verse><verse>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
</verse><verse>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
</verse><verse>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <supplied>were</supplied> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
</verse><verse>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
</verse><verse>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <supplied>and</supplied> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
</verse><verse>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <supplied>this</supplied> unto the magicians; but <supplied>there was</supplied> none that could declare <supplied>it</supplied> to me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <supplied>is</supplied> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <supplied>is</supplied> about to do.
</verse><verse>The seven good kine <supplied>are</supplied> seven years; and the seven good ears <supplied>are</supplied> seven years: the dream <supplied>is</supplied> one.
</verse><verse>And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <supplied>are</supplied> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <supplied>is</supplied> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
</verse><verse>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
</verse><verse>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
</verse><verse>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <supplied>shall be</supplied> very grievous.
</verse><verse>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <supplied>it is</supplied> because the thing <supplied>is</supplied> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
</verse><verse>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>Let Pharaoh do <supplied>this,</supplied> and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
</verse><verse>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
</verse><verse>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <supplied>such a one</supplied> as this <supplied>is,</supplied> a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <supplied>there is</supplied> none so discreet and wise as thou <supplied>art: </supplied></verse><verse>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the
throne will I be greater than thou.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph&#x2019;s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
</verse><verse>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <supplied>ruler</supplied> over all the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <supplied>am</supplied> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh called Joseph&#x2019;s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <supplied>all</supplied> the land of Egypt.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joseph <supplied>was</supplied> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
</verse><verse>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <supplied>was</supplied> round about every city, laid he up in the same.
</verse><verse>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <supplied>it was</supplied> without number.
</verse><verse>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.
</verse><verse>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <supplied>said he,</supplied> hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father&#x2019;s house.
</verse><verse>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
</verse><verse>And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
</verse><verse>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
</verse><verse>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <supplied>corn;</supplied> because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
