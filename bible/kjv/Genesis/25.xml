      <verse>Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name <supplied>was</supplied> Keturah.
</verse><verse>And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

      </verse>
      <verse>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
</verse><verse>But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
</verse><verse>And these <supplied>are</supplied> the days of the years of Abraham&#x2019;s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
</verse><verse>Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full <supplied>of years;</supplied> and was gathered to his people.
</verse><verse>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which <supplied>is</supplied> before Mamre;
</verse><verse>The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now these <supplied>are</supplied> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&#x2019;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&#x2019;s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

</verse><verse>And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
</verse><verse>Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
</verse><verse>These <supplied>are</supplied> the sons of Ishmael, and these <supplied>are</supplied> their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
</verse><verse>And these <supplied>are</supplied> the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
</verse><verse>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that <supplied>is</supplied> before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: <supplied>and</supplied> he died in the presence of all his brethren.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And these <supplied>are</supplied> the generations of Isaac, Abraham&#x2019;s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
</verse><verse>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
</verse><verse>And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she <supplied>was</supplied> barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
</verse><verse>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If <supplied>it be</supplied> so, why <supplied>am</supplied> I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto her, Two nations <supplied>are</supplied> in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and <supplied>the one</supplied> people shall be stronger than <supplied>the other</supplied> people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, <supplied>there were</supplied> twins in her womb.
</verse><verse>And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
</verse><verse>And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&#x2019;s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac <supplied>was</supplied> threescore years old when she bare them.
</verse><verse>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob <supplied>was</supplied> a plain man, dwelling in tents.
</verse><verse>And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of <supplied>his</supplied> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he <supplied>was</supplied> faint:
</verse><verse>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <supplied>pottage;</supplied> for I <supplied>am</supplied> faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
</verse><verse>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
</verse><verse>And Esau said, Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
</verse><verse>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
</verse><verse>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised <supplied>his</supplied> birthright.
