      <verse>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that <supplied>was</supplied> with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
</verse><verse>The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
</verse><verse>And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
</verse><verse>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
</verse><verse>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <supplied>month,</supplied> on the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
</verse><verse>And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
</verse><verse>Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
</verse><verse>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <supplied>were</supplied> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
</verse><verse>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
</verse><verse>And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth <supplied>was</supplied> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
</verse><verse>And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first <supplied>month,</supplied> the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face
of the ground was dry.
</verse><verse>And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And God spake unto Noah, saying,
</verse><verse>Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
</verse><verse>Bring forth with thee every living thing that <supplied>is</supplied> with thee, of all flesh, <supplied>both</supplied> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and
multiply upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:
</verse><verse>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, <supplied>and</supplied> whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
</verse><verse>And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart <supplied>is</supplied> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing
living, as I have done.
</verse><verse>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
