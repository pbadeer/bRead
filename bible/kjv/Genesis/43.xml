      <verse>And the famine <supplied>was</supplied> sore in the land.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
</verse><verse>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <supplied>be</supplied> with you.
</verse><verse>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
</verse><verse>But if thou wilt not send <supplied>him,</supplied> we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <supplied>be</supplied> with you.
</verse><verse>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
</verse><verse>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <supplied>Is</supplied> your father yet alive? have ye <supplied>another</supplied> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would
say, Bring your brother down?
</verse><verse>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <supplied>and</supplied> also our little ones.
</verse><verse>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
</verse><verse>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
</verse><verse>And their father Israel said unto them, If <supplied>it must be</supplied> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
</verse><verse>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <supplied>it</supplied> again in your hand; peradventure it <supplied>was</supplied> an oversight:
</verse><verse>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
</verse><verse>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <supplied>of my children,</supplied> I am bereaved.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
</verse><verse>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring <supplied>these</supplied> men home, and slay, and make ready; for <supplied>these</supplied> men shall dine with me at noon.
</verse><verse>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph&#x2019;s house.
</verse><verse>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph&#x2019;s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us
for bondmen, and our asses.
</verse><verse>And they came near to the steward of Joseph&#x2019;s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
</verse><verse>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <supplied>every</supplied> man&#x2019;s money <supplied>was</supplied> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
</verse><verse>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
</verse><verse>And he said, Peace <supplied>be</supplied> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
</verse><verse>And the man brought the men into Joseph&#x2019;s house, and gave <supplied>them</supplied> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
</verse><verse>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <supplied>was</supplied> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
</verse><verse>And he asked them of <supplied>their</supplied> welfare, and said, <supplied>Is</supplied> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <supplied>Is</supplied> he yet alive?
</verse><verse>And they answered, Thy servant our father <supplied>is</supplied> in good health, he <supplied>is</supplied> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
</verse><verse>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&#x2019;s son, and said, <supplied>Is</supplied> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
</verse><verse>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <supplied>where</supplied> to weep; and he entered into <supplied>his</supplied> chamber, and wept there.
</verse><verse>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
</verse><verse>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <supplied>is</supplied> an abomination unto the Egyptians.
</verse><verse>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
</verse><verse>And he took <supplied>and sent</supplied> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin&#x2019;s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
