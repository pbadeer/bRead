      <verse>And Abraham was old, <supplied>and</supplied> well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
</verse><verse>And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
</verse><verse>And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
</verse><verse>But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
</verse><verse>And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
</verse><verse>And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father&#x2019;s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt
take a wife unto my son from thence.
</verse><verse>And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
</verse><verse>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master <supplied>were</supplied> in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
</verse><verse>And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, <supplied>even</supplied> the time that women go out to draw <supplied>water. </supplied></verse><verse>And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good
speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
</verse><verse>Behold, I stand <supplied>here</supplied> by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
</verse><verse>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: <supplied>let the same be</supplied> she <supplied>that</supplied> thou hast appointed
for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&#x2019;s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
</verse><verse>And the damsel <supplied>was</supplied> very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
</verse><verse>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
</verse><verse>And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
</verse><verse>And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw <supplied>water</supplied> for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
</verse><verse>And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw <supplied>water,</supplied> and drew for all his camels.
</verse><verse>And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten <supplied>shekels</supplied> weight of gold;
</verse><verse>And said, Whose daughter <supplied>art</supplied> thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room <supplied>in</supplied> thy father&#x2019;s house for us to lodge in?
</verse><verse>And she said unto him, I <supplied>am</supplied> the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
</verse><verse>She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
</verse><verse>And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
</verse><verse>And he said, Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I <supplied>being</supplied> in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master&#x2019;s brethren.
</verse><verse>And the damsel ran, and told <supplied>them of</supplied> her mother&#x2019;s house these things.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name <supplied>was</supplied> Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister&#x2019;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the
well.
</verse><verse>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men&#x2019;s feet that <supplied>were</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>And there was set <supplied>meat</supplied> before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
</verse><verse>And he said, I <supplied>am</supplied> Abraham&#x2019;s servant.
</verse><verse>And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
</verse><verse>And Sarah my master&#x2019;s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
</verse><verse>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
</verse><verse>But thou shalt go unto my father&#x2019;s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
</verse><verse>And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father&#x2019;s house:
</verse><verse>Then shalt thou be clear from <supplied>this</supplied> my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee <supplied>one,</supplied> thou shalt be clear from my oath.
</verse><verse>And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;
</verse><verse>Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw <supplied>water,</supplied> and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
</verse><verse>And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: <supplied>let</supplied> the same <supplied>be</supplied> the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master&#x2019;s son.
</verse><verse>And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew <supplied>water:</supplied> and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
</verse><verse>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her <supplied>shoulder,</supplied> and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
</verse><verse>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter <supplied>art</supplied> thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&#x2019;s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
</verse><verse>And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s daughter unto his son.
</verse><verse>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
</verse><verse>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
</verse><verse>Behold, Rebekah <supplied>is</supplied> before thee, take <supplied>her,</supplied> and go, and let her be thy master&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham&#x2019;s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, <supplied>bowing himself</supplied> to the earth.
</verse><verse>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave <supplied>them</supplied> to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
</verse><verse>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that <supplied>were</supplied> with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
</verse><verse>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us <supplied>a few</supplied> days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
</verse><verse>And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
</verse><verse>And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
</verse><verse>And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham&#x2019;s servant, and his men.
</verse><verse>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> our sister, be thou <supplied>the mother</supplied> of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
</verse><verse>And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
</verse><verse>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels <supplied>were</supplied> coming.
</verse><verse>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
</verse><verse>For she <supplied>had</supplied> said unto the servant, What man <supplied>is</supplied> this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant <supplied>had</supplied> said, It <supplied>is</supplied> my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
</verse><verse>And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
</verse><verse>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#x2019;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother&#x2019;s <supplied>death.</supplied>
