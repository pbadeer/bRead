      <verse>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Hirah.
</verse><verse>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
</verse><verse>And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
</verse><verse>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
</verse><verse>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
</verse><verse>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Tamar.
</verse><verse>And Er, Judah&#x2019;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
</verse><verse>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother&#x2019;s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
</verse><verse>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother&#x2019;s wife, that he spilled <supplied>it</supplied> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
</verse><verse>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
</verse><verse>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father&#x2019;s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <supplied>did.</supplied> And Tamar went and dwelt in her father&#x2019;s house.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah&#x2019;s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
</verse><verse>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
</verse><verse>And she put her widow&#x2019;s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
</verse><verse>When Judah saw her, he thought her <supplied>to be</supplied> an harlot; because she had covered her face.
</verse><verse>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <supplied>was</supplied> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
</verse><verse>And he said, I will send <supplied>thee</supplied> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <supplied>me</supplied> a pledge, till thou send <supplied>it? </supplied></verse><verse>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy
staff that <supplied>is</supplied> in thine hand. And he gave <supplied>it</supplied> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
</verse><verse>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
</verse><verse>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <supplied>his</supplied> pledge from the woman&#x2019;s hand: but he found her not.
</verse><verse>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <supplied>is</supplied> the harlot, that <supplied>was</supplied> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <supplied>place. </supplied></verse><verse>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also
the men of the place said, <supplied>that</supplied> there was no harlot in this <supplied>place. </supplied></verse><verse>And Judah said, Let her take <supplied>it</supplied> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <supplied>is</supplied> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
</verse><verse>When she <supplied>was</supplied> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <supplied>are, am</supplied> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <supplied>are</supplied> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
</verse><verse>And Judah acknowledged <supplied>them,</supplied> and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins <supplied>were</supplied> in her womb.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that <supplied>the one</supplied> put out <supplied>his</supplied> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <supplied>this</supplied> breach <supplied>be</supplied> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
</verse><verse>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
