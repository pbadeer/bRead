      <verse>Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
</verse><verse>And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I <supplied>am</supplied> Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I <supplied>am</supplied> Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
</verse><verse>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
</verse><verse>For these two years <supplied>hath</supplied> the famine <supplied>been</supplied> in the land: and yet <supplied>there are</supplied> five years, in the which <supplied>there shall</supplied> neither <supplied>be</supplied> earing nor harvest.
</verse><verse>And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
</verse><verse>So now <supplied>it was</supplied> not you <supplied>that</supplied> sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
</verse><verse>And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children&#x2019;s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
</verse><verse>And there will I nourish thee; for yet <supplied>there are</supplied> five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
</verse><verse>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that <supplied>it is</supplied> my mouth that speaketh unto you.
</verse><verse>And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
</verse><verse>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin&#x2019;s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
</verse><verse>Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh&#x2019;s house, saying, Joseph&#x2019;s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
</verse><verse>And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
</verse><verse>Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
</verse><verse>Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt <supplied>is</supplied> yours.
</verse><verse>And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
</verse><verse>To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred <supplied>pieces</supplied> of silver, and five changes of raiment.
</verse><verse>And to his father he sent after this <supplied>manner;</supplied> ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
</verse><verse>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
</verse><verse>And told him, saying, Joseph <supplied>is</supplied> yet alive, and he <supplied>is</supplied> governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob&#x2019;s heart fainted, for he believed them not.
</verse><verse>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
</verse><verse>And Israel said, <supplied>It is</supplied> enough; Joseph my son <supplied>is</supplied> yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
