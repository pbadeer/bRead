      <verse>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
</verse><verse>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
</verse><verse>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
</verse><verse>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
</verse><verse>Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
</verse><verse>And the men of the place asked <supplied>him</supplied> of his wife; and he said, She <supplied>is</supplied> my sister: for he feared to say, <supplied>She is</supplied> my wife; lest, <supplied>said he,</supplied> the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she <supplied>was</supplied> fair to
look upon.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac <supplied>was</supplied> sporting with Rebekah his wife.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she <supplied>is</supplied> thy wife: and how saidst thou, She <supplied>is</supplied> my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech said, What <supplied>is</supplied> this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech charged all <supplied>his</supplied> people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
</verse><verse>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
</verse><verse>And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
</verse><verse>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
</verse><verse>For all the wells which his father&#x2019;s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
</verse><verse>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
</verse><verse>And Isaac&#x2019;s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
</verse><verse>And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac&#x2019;s herdmen, saying, The water <supplied>is</supplied> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
</verse><verse>And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
</verse><verse>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
</verse><verse>And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
</verse><verse>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I <supplied>am</supplied> the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I <supplied>am</supplied> with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham&#x2019;s sake.
</verse><verse>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac&#x2019;s servants digged a well.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
</verse><verse>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
</verse><verse>And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, <supplied>even</supplied> betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
</verse><verse>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou <supplied>art</supplied> now the blessed of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
</verse><verse>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac&#x2019;s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
</verse><verse>And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city <supplied>is</supplied> Beer-sheba unto this day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
</verse><verse>Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
