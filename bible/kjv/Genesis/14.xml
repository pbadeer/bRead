</verse><verse>And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
</verse><verse>And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
</verse><verse>That I will not <supplied>take</supplied> from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that <supplied>is</supplied> thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
</verse><verse>Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
