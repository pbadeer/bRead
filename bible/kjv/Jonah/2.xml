</verse><verse>And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, <supplied>and</supplied> thou heardest my voice.
</verse><verse>For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
</verse><verse>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
</verse><verse>The waters compassed me about, <supplied>even</supplied> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
</verse><verse>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars <supplied>was</supplied> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
</verse><verse>When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
</verse><verse>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
</verse><verse>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay <supplied>that</supplied> that I have vowed. Salvation <supplied>is</supplied> of the LORD.
