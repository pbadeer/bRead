      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
</verse><verse>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
</verse><verse>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&#x2019; journey.
</verse><verse>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&#x2019;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
</verse><verse>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <supplied>him</supplied> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
</verse><verse>And he caused <supplied>it</supplied> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:
</verse><verse>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <supplied>is</supplied> in their hands.
</verse><verse>Who can tell <supplied>if</supplied> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <supplied>it</supplied> not.
