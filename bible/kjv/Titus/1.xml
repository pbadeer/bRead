      <verse>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&#x2019;s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
</verse><verse>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
</verse><verse>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
</verse><verse>To Titus, <supplied>mine</supplied> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <supplied>and</supplied> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

      <verse>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
</verse><verse>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
</verse><verse>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
</verse><verse>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
</verse><verse>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
</verse><verse>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
</verse><verse>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre&#x2019;s sake.
</verse><verse>One of themselves, <supplied>even</supplied> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <supplied>are</supplied> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
</verse><verse>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
</verse><verse>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
</verse><verse>Unto the pure all things <supplied>are</supplied> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <supplied>is</supplied> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
</verse><verse>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <supplied>him,</supplied> being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
