      <verse>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
</verse><verse>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <supplied>certain</supplied> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <supplied>are</supplied> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <supplied>is</supplied> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <supplied>certain</supplied> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
</verse><verse>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
</verse><verse>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we
have sinned against thee: both I and my father&#x2019;s house have sinned.
</verse><verse>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
</verse><verse>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <supplied>If</supplied> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
</verse><verse>But <supplied>if</supplied> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <supplied>yet</supplied> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to
set my name there.
</verse><verse>Now these <supplied>are</supplied> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
</verse><verse>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.
For I was the king&#x2019;s cupbearer.
