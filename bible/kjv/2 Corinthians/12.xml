<chapter translation="KJV" testament="New" book="2CO" n="12">
      <verse>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
</verse><verse>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
</verse><verse>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
</verse><verse>How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
</verse><verse>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
</verse><verse>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <supplied>now</supplied> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <supplied>to be,</supplied> or <supplied>that</supplied> he heareth of me.
</verse><verse>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
</verse><verse>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, <jesus>My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</jesus> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
</verse><verse>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
</verse><verse>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
</verse><verse>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <supplied>it be</supplied> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
</verse><verse>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
</verse><verse>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
</verse><verse>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
</verse><verse>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
</verse><verse>I desired Titus, and with <supplied>him</supplied> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <supplied>walked we</supplied> not in the same steps?
</verse><verse>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <supplied>we do</supplied> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
</verse><verse>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <supplied>that</supplied> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <supplied>there be</supplied> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
</verse><verse><supplied>And</supplied> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <supplied>that</supplied> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
