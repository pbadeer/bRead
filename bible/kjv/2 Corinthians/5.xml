<chapter translation="KJV" testament="New" book="2 Corinthians" n="5" chapters="13">
      <verse>For we know that if our earthly house of <supplied>this</supplied> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
</verse><verse>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
</verse><verse>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
</verse><verse>For we that are in <supplied>this</supplied> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
</verse><verse>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <supplied>is</supplied> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
</verse><verse>Therefore <supplied>we are</supplied> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
</verse><verse>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
</verse><verse>We are confident, <supplied>I say,</supplied> and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
</verse><verse>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
</verse><verse>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <supplied>done</supplied> in <supplied>his</supplied> body, according to that he hath done, whether <supplied>it be</supplied> good or bad.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
</verse><verse>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <supplied>answer</supplied> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
</verse><verse>For whether we be beside ourselves, <supplied>it is</supplied> to God: or whether we be sober, <supplied>it is</supplied> for your cause.
</verse><verse>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
</verse><verse>And <supplied>that</supplied> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
</verse><verse>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <supplied>him</supplied> no more.
</verse><verse>Therefore if any man <supplied>be</supplied> in Christ, <supplied>he is</supplied> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
</verse><verse>And all things <supplied>are</supplied> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
</verse><verse>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
</verse><verse>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <supplied>you</supplied> by us: we pray <supplied>you</supplied> in Christ&#x2019;s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
</verse><verse>For he hath made him <supplied>to be</supplied> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
