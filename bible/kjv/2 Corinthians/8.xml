      <verse>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
</verse><verse>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
</verse><verse>For to <supplied>their</supplied> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <supplied>their</supplied> power <supplied>they were</supplied> willing of themselves;
</verse><verse>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <supplied>take upon us</supplied> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>this they did,</supplied> not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
</verse><verse>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
</verse><verse>Therefore, as ye abound in every <supplied>thing, in</supplied> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <supplied>in</supplied> all diligence, and <supplied>in</supplied> your love to us, <supplied>see</supplied> that ye abound in this grace also.
</verse><verse>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
</verse><verse>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
</verse><verse>And herein I give <supplied>my</supplied> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
</verse><verse>Now therefore perform the doing <supplied>of it;</supplied> that as <supplied>there was</supplied> a readiness to will, so <supplied>there may be</supplied> a performance also out of that which ye have.
</verse><verse>For if there be first a willing mind, <supplied>it is</supplied> accepted according to that a man hath, <supplied>and</supplied> not according to that he hath not.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>I mean</supplied> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
</verse><verse>But by an equality, <supplied>that</supplied> now at this time your abundance <supplied>may be a supply</supplied> for their want, that their abundance also may be <supplied>a supply</supplied> for your want: that there may be equality:
</verse><verse>As it is written, He that <supplied>had gathered</supplied> much had nothing over; and he that <supplied>had gathered</supplied> little had no lack.
</verse><verse>But thanks <supplied>be</supplied> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
</verse><verse>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
</verse><verse>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
</verse><verse>And not <supplied>that</supplied> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <supplied>declaration of</supplied> your ready mind:
</verse><verse>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
</verse><verse>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
</verse><verse>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <supplied>I have</supplied> in you.
</verse><verse>Whether <supplied>any do enquire</supplied> of Titus, <supplied>he is</supplied> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <supplied>be enquired of, they are</supplied> the messengers of the churches, <supplied>and</supplied> the glory of Christ.
</verse><verse>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
