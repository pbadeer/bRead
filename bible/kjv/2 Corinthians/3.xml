      <verse>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <supplied>others,</supplied> epistles of commendation to you, or <supplied>letters</supplied> of commendation from you?
</verse><verse>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
</verse><verse><supplied>Forasmuch as ye are</supplied> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
</verse><verse>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <supplied>is</supplied> of God;
</verse><verse>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
</verse><verse>But if the ministration of death, written <supplied>and</supplied> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <supplied>glory</supplied> was to be done away:
</verse><verse>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
</verse><verse>For if the ministration of condemnation <supplied>be</supplied> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
</verse><verse>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
</verse><verse>For if that which is done away <supplied>was</supplied> glorious, much more that which remaineth <supplied>is</supplied> glorious.
</verse><verse>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
</verse><verse>And not as Moses, <supplied>which</supplied> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
</verse><verse>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <supplied>vail</supplied> is done away in Christ.
</verse><verse>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
</verse><verse>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <supplied>is,</supplied> there <supplied>is</supplied> liberty.
</verse><verse>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <supplied>even</supplied> as by the Spirit of the Lord.
