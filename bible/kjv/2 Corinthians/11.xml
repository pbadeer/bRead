      <verse>Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <supplied>my</supplied> folly: and indeed bear with me.
</verse><verse>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <supplied>you as</supplied> a chaste virgin to Christ.
</verse><verse>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
</verse><verse>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <supplied>if</supplied> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <supplied>him. </supplied></verse><verse>For I
suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
</verse><verse>But though <supplied>I be</supplied> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
</verse><verse>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
</verse><verse>I robbed other churches, taking wages <supplied>of them,</supplied> to do you service.
</verse><verse>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <supplied>things</supplied> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will
I keep <supplied>myself. </supplied></verse><verse>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
</verse><verse>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
</verse><verse>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
</verse><verse>For such <supplied>are</supplied> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
</verse><verse>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
</verse><verse>Therefore <supplied>it is</supplied> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
</verse><verse>That which I speak, I speak <supplied>it</supplied> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
</verse><verse>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
</verse><verse>For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <supplied>yourselves</supplied> are wise.
</verse><verse>For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <supplied>you,</supplied> if a man take <supplied>of you,</supplied> if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
</verse><verse>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
</verse><verse>Are they Hebrews? so <supplied>am</supplied> I. Are they Israelites? so <supplied>am</supplied> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <supplied>am</supplied> I.
</verse><verse>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <supplied>am</supplied> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
</verse><verse>Of the Jews five times received I forty <supplied>stripes</supplied> save one.
</verse><verse>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
</verse><verse><supplied>In</supplied> journeyings often, <supplied>in</supplied> perils of waters, <supplied>in</supplied> perils of robbers, <supplied>in</supplied> perils by <supplied>mine own</supplied> countrymen, <supplied>in</supplied> perils by the heathen, <supplied>in</supplied> perils in the city, <supplied>in</supplied> perils in the wilderness,
<supplied>in</supplied> perils in the sea, <supplied>in</supplied> perils among false brethren;
</verse><verse>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
</verse><verse>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
</verse><verse>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
</verse><verse>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
</verse><verse>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
</verse><verse>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
</verse><verse>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
