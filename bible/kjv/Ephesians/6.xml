      <verse>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
</verse><verse>Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
</verse><verse>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
</verse><verse>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
</verse><verse>Servants, be obedient to them that are <supplied>your</supplied> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
</verse><verse>Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
</verse><verse>With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
</verse><verse>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether <supplied>he be</supplied> bond or free.
</verse><verse>And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
</verse><verse>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
</verse><verse>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <supplied>places. </supplied></verse><verse>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of
God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
</verse><verse>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
</verse><verse>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
</verse><verse>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
</verse><verse>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
</verse><verse>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
</verse><verse>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
</verse><verse>For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But that ye also may know my affairs, <supplied>and</supplied> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
</verse><verse>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and <supplied>that</supplied> he might comfort your hearts.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Peace <supplied>be</supplied> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>Grace <supplied>be</supplied> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
