      <verse>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
</verse><verse>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
</verse><verse>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
</verse><verse>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
</verse><verse>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
</verse><verse>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
</verse><verse>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
</verse><verse>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <supplied>are ye</supplied> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
</verse><verse>(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
</verse><verse>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
</verse><verse>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
</verse><verse>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
</verse><verse>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
</verse><verse>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
</verse><verse>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
</verse><verse>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <supplied>is. </supplied></verse><verse>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
</verse><verse>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
</verse><verse>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
</verse><verse>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
</verse><verse>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
</verse><verse>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
</verse><verse>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <supplied>let</supplied> the wives <supplied>be</supplied> to their own husbands in every thing.
</verse><verse>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
</verse><verse>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
</verse><verse>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
</verse><verse>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
</verse><verse>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
</verse><verse>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
</verse><verse>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
</verse><verse>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <supplied>see</supplied> that she reverence <supplied>her</supplied> husband.
