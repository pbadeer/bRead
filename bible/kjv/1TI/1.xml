      <verse>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <supplied>which is</supplied> our hope;
</verse><verse>Unto Timothy, <supplied>my</supplied> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <supplied>and</supplied> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
</verse><verse>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <supplied>so do. </supplied></verse><verse>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <supplied>of</supplied> a good conscience,
and <supplied>of</supplied> faith unfeigned:
</verse><verse>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
</verse><verse>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
</verse><verse>But we know that the law <supplied>is</supplied> good, if a man use it lawfully;
</verse><verse>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
</verse><verse>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
</verse><verse>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
</verse><verse>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
</verse><verse>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <supplied>it</supplied> ignorantly in unbelief.
</verse><verse>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
</verse><verse>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
</verse><verse>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <supplied>be</supplied> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</verse><verse>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
</verse><verse>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
</verse><verse>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
