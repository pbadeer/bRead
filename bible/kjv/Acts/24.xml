      <verse>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and <supplied>with</supplied> a certain orator <supplied>named</supplied> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
</verse><verse>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <supplied>him,</supplied> saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
</verse><verse>We accept <supplied>it</supplied> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
</verse><verse>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
</verse><verse>For we have found this man <supplied>a</supplied> pestilent <supplied>fellow,</supplied> and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
</verse><verse>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
</verse><verse>But the chief captain Lysias came <supplied>upon us,</supplied> and with great violence took <supplied>him</supplied> away out of our hands,
</verse><verse>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
</verse><verse>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
</verse><verse>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
</verse><verse>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
</verse><verse>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
</verse><verse>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
</verse><verse>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
</verse><verse>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
</verse><verse>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <supplied>toward</supplied> men.
</verse><verse>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
</verse><verse>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
</verse><verse>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
</verse><verse>Or else let these same <supplied>here</supplied> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
</verse><verse>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <supplied>that</supplied> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
</verse><verse>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <supplied>him</supplied> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
</verse><verse>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
</verse><verse>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
</verse><verse>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix&#x2019; room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
