      <verse>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
</verse><verse>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
</verse><verse>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
</verse><verse>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
</verse><verse>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <supplied>that</supplied> Jesus <supplied>was</supplied> Christ.
</verse><verse>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <supplied>his</supplied> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <supplied>be</supplied> upon your own heads; I <supplied>am</supplied> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <supplied>man&#x2019;s</supplied> house, named Justus, <supplied>one</supplied> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
</verse><verse>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
</verse><verse>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, <jesus>Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. </jesus></verse><verse>And he
continued <supplied>there</supplied> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
</verse><verse>Saying, This <supplied>fellow</supplied> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
</verse><verse>And when Paul was now about to open <supplied>his</supplied> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <supplied>ye</supplied> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
</verse><verse>But if it be a question of words and names, and <supplied>of</supplied> your law, look ye <supplied>to it;</supplied> for I will be no judge of such <supplied>matters. </supplied></verse><verse>And he drave them from the judgment seat.
</verse><verse>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <supplied>him</supplied> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Paul <supplied>after this</supplied> tarried <supplied>there</supplied> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <supplied>his</supplied> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
</verse><verse>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
</verse><verse>When they desired <supplied>him</supplied> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
</verse><verse>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
</verse><verse>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
</verse><verse>And after he had spent some time <supplied>there,</supplied> he departed, and went over <supplied>all</supplied> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <supplied>and</supplied> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
</verse><verse>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
</verse><verse>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <supplied>them,</supplied> and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
</verse><verse>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
</verse><verse>For he mightily convinced the Jews, <supplied>and that</supplied> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
