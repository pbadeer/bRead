      <verse>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
</verse><verse>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
</verse><verse>And they laid hands on them, and put <supplied>them</supplied> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
</verse><verse>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
</verse><verse>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
</verse><verse>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
</verse><verse>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
</verse><verse>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <supplied>even</supplied> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
</verse><verse>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
</verse><verse>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
</verse><verse>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
</verse><verse>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
</verse><verse>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <supplied>is</supplied> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>But that it spread no further among the people, let
us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
</verse><verse>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
</verse><verse>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
</verse><verse>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
</verse><verse>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <supplied>men</supplied> glorified God for that which was done.
</verse><verse>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
</verse><verse>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <supplied>art</supplied> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
</verse><verse>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
</verse><verse>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
</verse><verse>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
</verse><verse>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
</verse><verse>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
</verse><verse>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
</verse><verse>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <supplied>of them</supplied> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
</verse><verse>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
</verse><verse>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
</verse><verse>And laid <supplied>them</supplied> down at the apostles&#x2019; feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
</verse><verse>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <supplied>and</supplied> of the country of Cyprus,
</verse><verse>Having land, sold <supplied>it,</supplied> and brought the money, and laid <supplied>it</supplied> at the apostles&#x2019; feet.
