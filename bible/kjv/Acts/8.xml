      <verse>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
</verse><verse>And devout men carried Stephen <supplied>to his burial,</supplied> and made great lamentation over him.
</verse><verse>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <supplied>them</supplied> to prison.
</verse><verse>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
</verse><verse>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
</verse><verse>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
</verse><verse>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <supplied>with them:</supplied> and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
</verse><verse>And there was great joy in that city.
</verse><verse>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
</verse><verse>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
</verse><verse>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
</verse><verse>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
</verse><verse>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
</verse><verse>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
</verse><verse>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
</verse><verse>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
</verse><verse>Then laid they <supplied>their</supplied> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
</verse><verse>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles&#x2019; hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
</verse><verse>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
</verse><verse>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
</verse><verse>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
</verse><verse>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
</verse><verse>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <supplied>in</supplied> the bond of iniquity.
</verse><verse>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
</verse><verse>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
</verse><verse>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
</verse><verse>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
</verse><verse>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
</verse><verse>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
</verse><verse>And Philip ran thither to <supplied>him,</supplied> and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
</verse><verse>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
</verse><verse>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
</verse><verse>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
</verse><verse>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
</verse><verse>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
</verse><verse>And as they went on <supplied>their</supplied> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <supplied>here is</supplied> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
</verse><verse>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
</verse><verse>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
</verse><verse>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
</verse><verse>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
