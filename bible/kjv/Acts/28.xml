      <verse>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
</verse><verse>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
</verse><verse>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <supplied>them</supplied> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
</verse><verse>And when the barbarians saw the <supplied>venomous</supplied> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
</verse><verse>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
</verse><verse>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
</verse><verse>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
</verse><verse>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <supplied>us</supplied> with such things as were necessary.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
</verse><verse>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <supplied>there</supplied> three days.
</verse><verse>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
</verse><verse>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
</verse><verse>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
</verse><verse>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <supplied>and</supplied> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our
fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
</verse><verse>Who, when they had examined me, would have let <supplied>me</supplied> go, because there was no cause of death in me.
</verse><verse>But when the Jews spake against <supplied>it,</supplied> I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
</verse><verse>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <supplied>you,</supplied> and to speak with <supplied>you:</supplied> because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
</verse><verse>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
</verse><verse>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
</verse><verse>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <supplied>his</supplied> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <supplied>out of</supplied> the prophets,
from morning till evening.
</verse><verse>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
</verse><verse>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
</verse><verse>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
</verse><verse>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <supplied>their</supplied> eyes, and hear with <supplied>their</supplied> ears, and understand with <supplied>their</supplied> heart, and
should be converted, and I should heal them.
</verse><verse>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <supplied>that</supplied> they will hear it.
</verse><verse>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
</verse><verse>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
