      <verse>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
</verse><verse>She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.
</verse><verse>Her princes within her <supplied>are</supplied> roaring lions; her judges <supplied>are</supplied> evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
</verse><verse>Her prophets <supplied>are</supplied> light <supplied>and</supplied> treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
</verse><verse>The just LORD <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
</verse><verse>I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.
</verse><verse>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, <supplied>and</supplied> corrupted all their doings.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination <supplied>is</supplied> to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, <supplied>even</supplied> all my fierce anger:
for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
</verse><verse>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.
</verse><verse>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, <supplied>even</supplied> the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
</verse><verse>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy
mountain.
</verse><verse>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.
</verse><verse>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make <supplied>them</supplied> afraid.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, <supplied>even</supplied> the LORD, <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.
</verse><verse>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: <supplied>and to</supplied> Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.
</verse><verse>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee <supplied>is</supplied> mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.
</verse><verse>I will gather <supplied>them that are</supplied> sorrowful for the solemn assembly, <supplied>who</supplied> are of thee, <supplied>to whom</supplied> the reproach of it <supplied>was</supplied> a burden.
</verse><verse>Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
</verse><verse>At that time will I bring you <supplied>again,</supplied> even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
