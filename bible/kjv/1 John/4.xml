      <verse>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
</verse><verse>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
</verse><verse>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <supplied>spirit</supplied> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
</verse><verse>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
</verse><verse>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
</verse><verse>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

      <verse>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
</verse><verse>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
</verse><verse>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
</verse><verse>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <supplied>to be</supplied> the propitiation for our sins.
</verse><verse>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
</verse><verse>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
</verse><verse>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
</verse><verse>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <supplied>to be</supplied> the Saviour of the world.
</verse><verse>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
</verse><verse>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
</verse><verse>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
</verse><verse>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
</verse><verse>We love him, because he first loved us.
</verse><verse>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
</verse><verse>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
