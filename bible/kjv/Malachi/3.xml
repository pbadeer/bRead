      <verse>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of
hosts.
</verse><verse>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he <supplied>is</supplied> like a refiner&#x2019;s fire, and like fullers&#x2019; sope:
</verse><verse>And he shall sit <supplied>as</supplied> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.
</verse><verse>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
</verse><verse>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in <supplied>his</supplied> wages, the widow, and the
fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <supplied>from his right,</supplied> and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept <supplied>them.</supplied> Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
</verse><verse>Ye <supplied>are</supplied> cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, <supplied>even</supplied> this whole nation.
</verse><verse>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that <supplied>there shall</supplied> not
<supplied>be room</supplied> enough <supplied>to receive it. </supplied></verse><verse>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken <supplied>so much</supplied> against thee?
</verse><verse>Ye have said, It <supplied>is</supplied> vain to serve God: and what profit <supplied>is it</supplied> that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
</verse><verse>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, <supplied>they that</supplied> tempt God are even delivered.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard <supplied>it,</supplied> and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
</verse><verse>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
</verse><verse>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
