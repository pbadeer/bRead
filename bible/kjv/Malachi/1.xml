      <verse>The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
</verse><verse>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <supplied>Was</supplied> not Esau Jacob&#x2019;s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
</verse><verse>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
</verse><verse>Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom
the LORD hath indignation for ever.
</verse><verse>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A son honoureth <supplied>his</supplied> father, and a servant his master: if then I <supplied>be</supplied> a father, where <supplied>is</supplied> mine honour? and if I <supplied>be</supplied> a master, where <supplied>is</supplied> my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my
name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
</verse><verse>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> contemptible.
</verse><verse>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <supplied>is it</supplied> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <supplied>is it</supplied> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is there</supplied> even among you that would shut the doors <supplied>for nought?</supplied> neither do ye kindle <supplied>fire</supplied> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
</verse><verse>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <supplied>shall be</supplied> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <supplied>shall be</supplied> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <supplied>shall be</supplied> great
among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <supplied>even</supplied> his meat, <supplied>is</supplied> contemptible.
</verse><verse>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness <supplied>is it!</supplied> and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought <supplied>that which was</supplied> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?
saith the LORD.
</verse><verse>But cursed <supplied>be</supplied> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I <supplied>am</supplied> a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name <supplied>is</supplied> dreadful among the heathen.
