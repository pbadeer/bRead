      <verse>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
</verse><verse>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
</verse><verse>And command thou the people, saying, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
</verse><verse>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <supplied>for</supplied> a possession.
</verse><verse>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
</verse><verse>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God <supplied>hath been</supplied> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
</verse><verse>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land <supplied>for</supplied> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <supplied>for</supplied> a possession.
</verse><verse>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
</verse><verse>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
</verse><verse>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.
</verse><verse>Now rise up, <supplied>said I,</supplied> and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
</verse><verse>And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, <supplied>was</supplied> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.
</verse><verse>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
</verse><verse>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
</verse><verse>And <supplied>when</supplied> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <supplied>any</supplied> possession; because I have given it unto the children of
Lot <supplied>for</supplied> a possession.
</verse><verse>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
</verse><verse>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
</verse><verse>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
</verse><verse>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <supplied>even</supplied> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <supplied>it,</supplied> and contend with him in battle.
</verse><verse>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <supplied>that are</supplied> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
</verse><verse>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
</verse><verse>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
</verse><verse>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as <supplied>appeareth</supplied> this day.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
</verse><verse>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
</verse><verse>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
</verse><verse>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
</verse><verse>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
</verse><verse>From Aroer, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and <supplied>from</supplied> the city that <supplied>is</supplied> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:
</verse><verse>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, <supplied>nor</supplied> unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.
