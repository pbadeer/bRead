</verse><verse>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

</verse><verse>Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
     
      </verse>

      <verse>If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

      </verse>
      <verse>Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
</verse><verse>And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:
</verse><verse>For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:

      </verse>
      <verse>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

</verse><verse>That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; <supplied>even</supplied> a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
