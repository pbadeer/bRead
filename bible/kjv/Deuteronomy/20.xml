      <verse>When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, <supplied>and</supplied> a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God <supplied>is</supplied> with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
</verse><verse>And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
</verse><verse>For the LORD your God <supplied>is</supplied> he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man <supplied>is there</supplied> that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
</verse><verse>And what man <supplied>is he</supplied> that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not <supplied>yet</supplied> eaten of it? let him <supplied>also</supplied> go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
</verse><verse>And what man <supplied>is there</supplied> that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
</verse><verse>And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man <supplied>is there that is</supplied> fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren&#x2019;s heart faint as well as his heart.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

      <verse>When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, <supplied>that</supplied> all the people <supplied>that is</supplied> found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
</verse><verse>And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
</verse><verse>And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
</verse><verse>But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, <supplied>even</supplied> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
</verse><verse>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities <supplied>which are</supplied> very far off from thee, which <supplied>are</supplied> not of the cities of these nations.
</verse><verse>But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee <supplied>for</supplied> an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
</verse><verse>But thou shalt utterly destroy them; <supplied>namely,</supplied> the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
</verse><verse>That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field
<supplied>is</supplied> man&#x2019;s <supplied>life</supplied>) to employ <supplied>them</supplied> in the siege:
</verse><verse>Only the trees which thou knowest that they <supplied>be</supplied> not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
