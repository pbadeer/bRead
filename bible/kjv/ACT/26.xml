      <verse>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
</verse><verse>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
</verse><verse>Especially <supplied>because I know</supplied> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
</verse><verse>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
</verse><verse>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
</verse><verse>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
</verse><verse>Unto which <supplied>promise</supplied> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <supplied>God</supplied> day and night, hope to come. For which hopeâ€™s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
</verse><verse>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
</verse><verse>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
</verse><verse>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>And I punished them oft in
every synagogue, and compelled <supplied>them</supplied> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <supplied>them</supplied> even unto strange cities.
</verse><verse>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
</verse><verse>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
</verse><verse>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <jesus>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <supplied>it is</supplied> hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </jesus></verse><verse>And I said, Who art thou,
Lord? And he said, <jesus>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those
things in the which I will appear unto thee; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Delivering thee from the people, and <supplied>from</supplied> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>To open their eyes, <supplied>and</supplied> to turn <supplied>them</supplied> from darkness to light, and
<supplied>from</supplied> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. </jesus></verse><verse>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
</verse><verse>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <supplied>then</supplied> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
</verse><verse>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <supplied>me. </supplied></verse><verse>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the
prophets and Moses did say should come:
</verse><verse>That Christ should suffer, <supplied>and</supplied> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
</verse><verse>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
</verse><verse>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
</verse><verse>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
</verse><verse>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
</verse><verse>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
</verse><verse>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
</verse><verse>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
</verse><verse>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
