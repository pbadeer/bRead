      <verse>And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Micah.
</verse><verse>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred <supplied>shekels</supplied> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed <supplied>be
thou</supplied> of the LORD, my son.
</verse><verse>And when he had restored the eleven hundred <supplied>shekels</supplied> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will
restore it unto thee.
</verse><verse>Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <supplied>shekels</supplied> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
</verse><verse>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

      <verse>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who <supplied>was</supplied> a Levite, and he sojourned there.
</verse><verse>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find <supplied>a place:</supplied> and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
</verse><verse>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I <supplied>am</supplied> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find <supplied>a place. </supplied></verse><verse>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a
priest, and I will give thee ten <supplied>shekels</supplied> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
</verse><verse>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
