      <verse>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
</verse><verse>Knowing <supplied>this,</supplied> that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
</verse><verse>But let patience have <supplied>her</supplied> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
</verse><verse>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <supplied>men</supplied> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
</verse><verse>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
</verse><verse>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
</verse><verse>A double minded man <supplied>is</supplied> unstable in all his ways.
</verse><verse>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
</verse><verse>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
</verse><verse>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
</verse><verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
</verse><verse>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
</verse><verse>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
</verse><verse>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
</verse><verse>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
</verse><verse>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
</verse><verse>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
</verse><verse>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
</verse><verse>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
</verse><verse>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
</verse><verse>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
</verse><verse>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
</verse><verse>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <supplied>therein,</supplied> he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
</verse><verse>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this manâ€™s religion <supplied>is</supplied> vain.
</verse><verse>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <supplied>and</supplied> to keep himself unspotted from the world.
