      <verse>From whence <supplied>come</supplied> wars and fightings among you? <supplied>come they</supplied> not hence, <supplied>even</supplied> of your lusts that war in your members?
</verse><verse>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
</verse><verse>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume <supplied>it</supplied> upon your lusts.
</verse><verse>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
</verse><verse>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
</verse><verse>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
</verse><verse>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
</verse><verse>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <supplied>your</supplied> hands, <supplied>ye</supplied> sinners; and purify <supplied>your</supplied> hearts, <supplied>ye</supplied> double minded.
</verse><verse>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and <supplied>your</supplied> joy to heaviness.
</verse><verse>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
</verse><verse>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of <supplied>his</supplied> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
</verse><verse>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
</verse><verse>Whereas ye know not what <supplied>shall be</supplied> on the morrow. For what <supplied>is</supplied> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
</verse><verse>For that ye <supplied>ought</supplied> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
</verse><verse>But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
</verse><verse>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <supplied>it</supplied> not, to him it is sin.
