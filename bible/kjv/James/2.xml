      <verse>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <supplied>the Lord</supplied> of glory, with respect of persons.
</verse><verse>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
</verse><verse>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
</verse><verse>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
</verse><verse>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
</verse><verse>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
</verse><verse>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
</verse><verse>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
</verse><verse>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
</verse><verse>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <supplied>point,</supplied> he is guilty of all.
</verse><verse>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
</verse><verse>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
</verse><verse>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
</verse><verse>What <supplied>doth it</supplied> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
</verse><verse>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
</verse><verse>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <supplied>doth it</supplied> profit?
</verse><verse>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
</verse><verse>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
</verse><verse>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
</verse><verse>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
</verse><verse>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
</verse><verse>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
</verse><verse>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
</verse><verse>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
</verse><verse>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <supplied>them</supplied> out another way?
</verse><verse>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
