      <verse>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
</verse><verse>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
</verse><verse>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <jesus>Behold, a sower went forth to sow; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when he sowed, some <supplied>seeds</supplied> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Some fell upon stony
places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And some fell among
thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. </jesus></verse><verse>And the
disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
</verse><verse>He answered and said unto them, <jesus>Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but
whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For this people&#x2019;s heart is waxed gross, and <supplied>their</supplied> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes
they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <supplied>their</supplied> eyes, and hear with <supplied>their</supplied> ears, and should understand with <supplied>their</supplied> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But blessed <supplied>are</supplied> your
eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <supplied>men</supplied> have desired to see <supplied>those things</supplied> which ye see, and have not seen <supplied>them;</supplied> and to hear <supplied>those
things</supplied> which ye hear, and have not heard <supplied>them.</supplied>
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <supplied>it</supplied> not, then cometh the wicked <supplied>one,</supplied> and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This
is he which received seed by the way side. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while:
for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the
word, and he becometh unfruitful. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <supplied>it;</supplied> which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <jesus>The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it
tares? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <jesus>The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the
greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Another parable spake he unto them; <jesus>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. </jesus></verse><verse>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
and without a parable spake he not unto them:
</verse><verse>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
</verse><verse>He answered and said unto them, <jesus>He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <supplied>one;
</supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad
away. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
</jesus></verse><verse>Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Have ye understood all these things?</jesus> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
</verse><verse>Then said he unto them, <jesus>Therefore every scribe <supplied>which is</supplied> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <supplied>that is</supplied> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <supplied>things</supplied> new and old.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
</verse><verse>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <supplied>man</supplied> this wisdom, and <supplied>these</supplied> mighty works?
</verse><verse>Is not this the carpenter&#x2019;s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
</verse><verse>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <supplied>man</supplied> all these things?
</verse><verse>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <jesus>A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. </jesus></verse><verse>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
