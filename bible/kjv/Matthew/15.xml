      <verse>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
</verse><verse>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
</verse><verse>But he answered and said unto them, <jesus>Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <supplied>his</supplied> father or <supplied>his</supplied> mother, <supplied>It is</supplied> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And honour not his father or his mother, <supplied>he shall be free.</supplied> Thus have
ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus><supplied>Ye</supplied> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <supplied>their</supplied> lips;
but their heart is far from me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But in vain they do worship me, teaching <supplied>for</supplied> doctrines the commandments of men.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, <jesus>Hear, and understand: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. </jesus></verse><verse>Then came his disciples,
and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
</verse><verse>But he answered and said, <jesus>Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
</jesus></verse><verse>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
</verse><verse>And Jesus said, <jesus>Are ye also yet without understanding? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But those things which proceed
out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>These are <supplied>the things</supplied> which
defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
</verse><verse>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <supplied>thou</supplied> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
</verse><verse>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
</verse><verse>But he answered and said, <jesus>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </jesus></verse><verse>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
</verse><verse>But he answered and said, <jesus>It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast <supplied>it</supplied> to dogs. </jesus></verse><verse>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, <jesus>O woman, great <supplied>is</supplied> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. </jesus></verse><verse>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
</verse><verse>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <supplied>those that were</supplied> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
</verse><verse>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Jesus called his disciples <supplied>unto him,</supplied> and said, <jesus>I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
</jesus></verse><verse>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
</verse><verse>And Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. </jesus></verse><verse>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
</verse><verse>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <supplied>them,</supplied> and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
</verse><verse>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <supplied>meat</supplied> that was left seven baskets full.
</verse><verse>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
</verse><verse>And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,
