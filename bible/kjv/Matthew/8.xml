      <verse>And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
</verse><verse>And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
</verse><verse>And Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>I will come and heal him. </jesus></verse><verse>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
</verse><verse>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this <supplied>man,</supplied> Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>When Jesus heard <supplied>it,</supplied> he
marvelled, and said to them that followed, <jesus>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </jesus></verse><verse>And Jesus said unto the centurion, <jesus>Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.

</verse><verse>And Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air <supplied>have</supplied> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <supplied>his</supplied> head. </jesus></verse><verse>And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and

</verse><verse>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
</verse><verse>And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
</verse><verse>So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
