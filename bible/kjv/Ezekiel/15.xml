      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, <supplied>or than</supplied> a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
</verse><verse>Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <supplied>men</supplied> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
</verse><verse>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for <supplied>any</supplied> work?
</verse><verse>Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for <supplied>any</supplied> work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from <supplied>one</supplied> fire, and <supplied>another</supplied> fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, when I set my face against them.
</verse><verse>And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
