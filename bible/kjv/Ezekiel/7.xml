      <verse>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
</verse><verse>Now <supplied>is</supplied> the end <supplied>come</supplied> upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
</verse><verse>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
</verse><verse>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.
</verse><verse>The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble <supplied>is</supplied> near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.
</verse><verse>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.
</verse><verse>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations <supplied>that</supplied> are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD that smiteth.
</verse><verse>Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
</verse><verse>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them <supplied>shall remain,</supplied> nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <supplied>shall there be</supplied> wailing for them.
</verse><verse>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <supplied>is</supplied> upon all the multitude thereof.
</verse><verse>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision <supplied>is</supplied> touching the whole multitude thereof, <supplied>which</supplied> shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his
life.
</verse><verse>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <supplied>is</supplied> upon all the multitude thereof.
</verse><verse>The sword <supplied>is</supplied> without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that <supplied>is</supplied> in the field shall die with the sword; and he that <supplied>is</supplied> in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
</verse><verse>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak <supplied>as</supplied> water.
</verse><verse>They shall also gird <supplied>themselves</supplied> with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
</verse><verse>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels:
because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations <supplied>and</supplied> of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.
</verse><verse>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
</verse><verse>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret <supplied>place:</supplied> for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
</verse><verse>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <supplied>there shall be</supplied> none.
</verse><verse>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
</verse><verse>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I
<supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
