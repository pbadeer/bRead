      <verse>In the tenth year, in the tenth <supplied>month,</supplied> in the twelfth <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:
</verse><verse>Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river <supplied>is</supplied> mine own, and I have made <supplied>it</supplied> for myself.
</verse><verse>But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.
</verse><verse>And I will leave thee <supplied>thrown</supplied> into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to
the fowls of the heaven.
</verse><verse>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
</verse><verse>When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.
</verse><verse>And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD: because he hath said, The river <supplied>is</supplied> mine, and I have made <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Behold, therefore I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, and against thy
rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste <supplied>and</supplied> desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
</verse><verse>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
</verse><verse>And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <supplied>that are</supplied> desolate, and her cities among the cities <supplied>that are</supplied> laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,
and will disperse them through the countries.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:
</verse><verse>And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return <supplied>into</supplied> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
</verse><verse>It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
</verse><verse>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth <supplied>their</supplied> iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <supplied>month,</supplied> in the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <supplied>was</supplied> made bald, and every shoulder <supplied>was</supplied> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he
had served against it:
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
</verse><verse>I have given him the land of Egypt <supplied>for</supplied> his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
