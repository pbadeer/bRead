      <verse>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;
</verse><verse>And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <supplied>which art</supplied> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <supplied>am</supplied> of perfect beauty.
</verse><verse>Thy borders <supplied>are</supplied> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
</verse><verse>They have made all thy <supplied>ship</supplied> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
</verse><verse><supplied>Of</supplied> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <supplied>of</supplied> ivory, <supplied>brought</supplied> out of the isles of Chittim.
</verse><verse>Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.
</verse><verse>The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise <supplied>men,</supplied> O Tyrus, <supplied>that</supplied> were in thee, were thy pilots.
</verse><verse>The ancients of Gebal and the wise <supplied>men</supplied> thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.
</verse><verse>They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
</verse><verse>The men of Arvad with thine army <supplied>were</supplied> upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.
</verse><verse>Tarshish <supplied>was</supplied> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <supplied>kind of</supplied> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.
</verse><verse>Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they <supplied>were</supplied> thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
</verse><verse>They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
</verse><verse>The men of Dedan <supplied>were</supplied> thy merchants; many isles <supplied>were</supplied> the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee <supplied>for</supplied> a present horns of ivory and ebony.
</verse><verse>Syria <supplied>was</supplied> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
</verse><verse>Judah, and the land of Israel, they <supplied>were</supplied> thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
</verse><verse>Damascus <supplied>was</supplied> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

</verse><verse>Dedan <supplied>was</supplied> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
</verse><verse>Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these <supplied>were they</supplied> thy merchants.

</verse><verse>Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, <supplied>and</supplied> Chilmad, <supplied>were</supplied> thy merchants.
</verse><verse>These <supplied>were</supplied> thy merchants in all sorts <supplied>of things,</supplied> in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
</verse><verse>The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
</verse><verse>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
</verse><verse>Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that <supplied>are</supplied> in thee, and in all thy company which <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst of thee, shall
fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
</verse><verse>The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
</verse><verse>And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <supplied>and</supplied> all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
</verse><verse>And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
</verse><verse>And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart <supplied>and</supplied> bitter wailing.
</verse><verse>And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, <supplied>saying,</supplied> What <supplied>city is</supplied> like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
</verse><verse>When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
</verse><verse>In the time <supplied>when</supplied> thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
</verse><verse>All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in <supplied>their</supplied> countenance.
</verse><verse>The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou <supplied>shalt be</supplied> a terror, and never shalt be any more.
