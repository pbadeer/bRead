      <verse>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and
brought me thither.
</verse><verse>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which <supplied>was</supplied> as the frame of a city on the south.
</verse><verse>And he brought me thither, and, behold, <supplied>there was</supplied> a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
</verse><verse>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew <supplied>them</supplied> unto thee <supplied>art</supplied> thou brought hither: declare all
that thou seest to the house of Israel.
</verse><verse>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring reed of six cubits <supplied>long</supplied> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <supplied>which was</supplied> one reed broad; and the other threshold <supplied>of the gate, which was</supplied> one reed broad.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>every</supplied> little chamber <supplied>was</supplied> one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers <supplied>were</supplied> five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <supplied>was</supplied> one reed.
</verse><verse>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
</verse><verse>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate <supplied>was</supplied> inward.
</verse><verse>And the little chambers of the gate eastward <supplied>were</supplied> three on this side, and three on that side; they three <supplied>were</supplied> of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
</verse><verse>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; <supplied>and</supplied> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
</verse><verse>The space also before the little chambers <supplied>was</supplied> one cubit <supplied>on this side,</supplied> and the space <supplied>was</supplied> one cubit on that side: and the little chambers <supplied>were</supplied> six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
</verse><verse>He measured then the gate from the roof of <supplied>one</supplied> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <supplied>was</supplied> five and twenty cubits, door against door.
</verse><verse>He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
</verse><verse>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate <supplied>were</supplied> fifty cubits.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>there were</supplied> narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows <supplied>were</supplied> round about inward: and upon <supplied>each</supplied> post <supplied>were</supplied> palm trees.
</verse><verse>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <supplied>there were</supplied> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <supplied>were</supplied> upon the pavement.
</verse><verse>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates <supplied>was</supplied> the lower pavement.
</verse><verse>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
</verse><verse>And the little chambers thereof <supplied>were</supplied> three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits, and the breadth five
and twenty cubits.
</verse><verse>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, <supplied>were</supplied> after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof <supplied>were</supplied> before them.
</verse><verse>And the gate of the inner court <supplied>was</supplied> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>there were</supplied> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>there were</supplied> seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof <supplied>were</supplied> before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>there was</supplied> a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
</verse><verse>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
</verse><verse>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and <supplied>there were</supplied> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: <supplied>it was</supplied> fifty cubits long, and five and twenty
cubits broad.
</verse><verse>And the arches round about <supplied>were</supplied> five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
</verse><verse>And the arches thereof <supplied>were</supplied> toward the utter court; and palm trees <supplied>were</supplied> upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it <supplied>had</supplied> eight steps.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
</verse><verse>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, <supplied>were</supplied> according to these measures: and <supplied>there were</supplied> windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: <supplied>it was</supplied> fifty cubits long, and five
and twenty cubits broad.
</verse><verse>And the arches thereof <supplied>were</supplied> toward the outward court; and palm trees <supplied>were</supplied> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <supplied>had</supplied> eight steps.
</verse><verse>And he brought me to the north gate, and measured <supplied>it</supplied> according to these measures;
</verse><verse>The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
</verse><verse>And the posts thereof <supplied>were</supplied> toward the utter court; and palm trees <supplied>were</supplied> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <supplied>had</supplied> eight steps.
</verse><verse>And the chambers and the entries thereof <supplied>were</supplied> by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And in the porch of the gate <supplied>were</supplied> two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
</verse><verse>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, <supplied>were</supplied> two tables; and on the other side, which <supplied>was</supplied> at the porch of the gate, <supplied>were</supplied> two tables.
</verse><verse>Four tables <supplied>were</supplied> on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew <supplied>their sacrifices. </supplied></verse><verse>And the four tables <supplied>were</supplied> of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit
and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
</verse><verse>And within <supplied>were</supplied> hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables <supplied>was</supplied> the flesh of the offering.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And without the inner gate <supplied>were</supplied> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <supplied>was</supplied> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <supplied>was</supplied> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <supplied>having</supplied> the
prospect toward the north.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect <supplied>is</supplied> toward the south, <supplied>is</supplied> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
</verse><verse>And the chamber whose prospect <supplied>is</supplied> toward the north <supplied>is</supplied> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these <supplied>are</supplied> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.
</verse><verse>So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar <supplied>that was</supplied> before the house.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured <supplied>each</supplied> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <supplied>was</supplied> three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
</verse><verse>The length of the porch <supplied>was</supplied> twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and <supplied>he brought me</supplied> by the steps whereby they went up to it: and <supplied>there were</supplied> pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
