      <verse>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
</verse><verse>And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.
</verse><verse>I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed <supplied>the blood of</supplied> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time <supplied>that their</supplied> iniquity <supplied>had</supplied> an end:
</verse><verse>Therefore, <supplied>as</supplied> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.
</verse><verse>Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
</verse><verse>And I will fill his mountains with his slain <supplied>men:</supplied> in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
</verse><verse>I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:
</verse><verse>Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, <supplied>and that</supplied> I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
</verse><verse>Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
</verse><verse>As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, <supplied>even</supplied> all of it: and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
