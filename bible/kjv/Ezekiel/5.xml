      <verse>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber&#x2019;s razor, and cause <supplied>it</supplied> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <supplied>hair. </supplied></verse><verse>Thou shalt burn with fire a
third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <supplied>and</supplied> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
</verse><verse>Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <supplied>for</supplied> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.

      <verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <supplied>is</supplied> Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries <supplied>that are</supplied> round about her.
</verse><verse>And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <supplied>are</supplied> round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that <supplied>are</supplied> round about you, <supplied>and</supplied> have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the
nations that <supplied>are</supplied> round about you;
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
</verse><verse>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
</verse><verse>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, <supplied>as</supplied> I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish <supplied>thee;</supplied> neither shall mine eye spare,
neither will I have any pity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out
a sword after them.
</verse><verse>Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it</supplied> in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
</verse><verse>Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that <supplied>are</supplied> round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
</verse><verse>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that <supplied>are</supplied> round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it.
</supplied></verse><verse>When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for <supplied>their</supplied> destruction, <supplied>and</supplied> which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:
</verse><verse>So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it.</supplied>
