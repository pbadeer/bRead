</verse><verse>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set <supplied>battering</supplied> rams against it round about.
</verse><verse>Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This <supplied>shall be</supplied> a sign to the house of Israel.
</verse><verse>Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <supplied>according</supplied> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
</verse><verse>For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
</verse><verse>And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
