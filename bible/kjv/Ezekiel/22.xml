      <verse>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
</verse><verse>Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
</verse><verse>Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come <supplied>even</supplied> unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach
unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
</verse><verse><supplied>Those that be</supplied> near, and <supplied>those that be</supplied> far from thee, shall mock thee, <supplied>which art</supplied> infamous <supplied>and</supplied> much vexed.
</verse><verse>Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
</verse><verse>In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
</verse><verse>Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
</verse><verse>In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
</verse><verse>In thee have they discovered their fathers&#x2019; nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
</verse><verse>And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour&#x2019;s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father&#x2019;s daughter.
</verse><verse>In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
</verse><verse>Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it,</supplied> and will do <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and
will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they <supplied>are</supplied> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are <supplied>even</supplied> the dross of silver.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt <supplied>it;</supplied> so will I gather <supplied>you</supplied> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave <supplied>you there,</supplied>
and melt you.
</verse><verse>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
</verse><verse>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, say unto her, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
</verse><verse>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed <supplied>difference</supplied> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my
sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
</verse><verse>Her princes in the midst thereof <supplied>are</supplied> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <supplied>and</supplied> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
</verse><verse>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <supplied>morter,</supplied> seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
</verse><verse>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
</verse><verse>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
</verse><verse>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
