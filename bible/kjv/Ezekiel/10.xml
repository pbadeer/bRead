      <verse>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
</verse><verse>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <supplied>even</supplied> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <supplied>them</supplied> over the city. And he went in in my
sight.
</verse><verse>Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
</verse><verse>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <supplied>and stood</supplied> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD&#x2019;S glory.
</verse><verse>And the sound of the cherubims&#x2019; wings was heard <supplied>even</supplied> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>one</supplied> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that <supplied>was</supplied> between the cherubims, and took <supplied>thereof,</supplied> and put <supplied>it</supplied> into the hands of <supplied>him that was</supplied> clothed with linen: who took
<supplied>it,</supplied> and went out.

      <verse>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man&#x2019;s hand under their wings.
</verse><verse>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <supplied>was</supplied> as the colour of a beryl stone.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>as for</supplied> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
</verse><verse>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
</verse><verse>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <supplied>were</supplied> full of eyes round about, <supplied>even</supplied> the wheels that they four had.
</verse><verse>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
</verse><verse>And every one had four faces: the first face <supplied>was</supplied> the face of a cherub, and the second face <supplied>was</supplied> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
</verse><verse>And the cherubims were lifted up. This <supplied>is</supplied> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
</verse><verse>And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
</verse><verse>When they stood, <supplied>these</supplied> stood; and when they were lifted up, <supplied>these</supplied> lifted up themselves <supplied>also:</supplied> for the spirit of the living creature <supplied>was</supplied> in them.
</verse><verse>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.
</verse><verse>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <supplied>were</supplied> beside them, and <supplied>every one</supplied> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD&#x2019;S house; and the glory of
the God of Israel <supplied>was</supplied> over them above.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <supplied>were</supplied> the cherubims.
</verse><verse>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man <supplied>was</supplied> under their wings.
</verse><verse>And the likeness of their faces <supplied>was</supplied> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.
