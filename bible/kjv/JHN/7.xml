      <verse>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
</verse><verse>Now the Jewsâ€™ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
</verse><verse>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> no man <supplied>that</supplied> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
</verse><verse>For neither did his brethren believe in him.
</verse><verse>Then Jesus said unto them, <jesus>My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Go ye up unto this feast: I
go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. </jesus></verse><verse>When he had said these words unto them, he abode <supplied>still</supplied> in Galilee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
</verse><verse>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
</verse><verse>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
</verse><verse>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
</verse><verse>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered them, and said, <jesus>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <supplied>whether</supplied> I speak of myself. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that
speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Did not Moses give you the law, and <supplied>yet</supplied> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to
kill me? </jesus></verse><verse>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto them, <jesus>I have done one work, and ye all marvel. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Judge not according to the appearance, but
judge righteous judgment. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
</verse><verse>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
</verse><verse>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
</verse><verse>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <jesus>Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent
me. </jesus></verse><verse>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</verse><verse>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <supplied>man</supplied> hath done?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus unto them, <jesus>Yet a little while am I with you, and <supplied>then</supplied> I go unto him that sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <supplied>me:</supplied> and where I am, <supplied>thither</supplied> ye cannot come. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said
the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
</verse><verse>What <supplied>manner of</supplied> saying is this that he said, <jesus>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <supplied>me:</supplied> and where I am, <supplied>thither</supplied> ye cannot come? </jesus></verse><verse>In the last day, that great <supplied>day</supplied> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
saying, <jesus>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </jesus></verse><verse>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that
believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <supplied>given;</supplied> because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
</verse><verse>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
</verse><verse>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
</verse><verse>So there was a division among the people because of him.
</verse><verse>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
</verse><verse>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
</verse><verse>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
</verse><verse>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
</verse><verse>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
</verse><verse>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
</verse><verse>Doth our law judge <supplied>any</supplied> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
</verse><verse>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
</verse><verse>And every man went unto his own house.
