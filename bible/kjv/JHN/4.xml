      <verse>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
</verse><verse>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
</verse><verse>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
</verse><verse>And he must needs go through Samaria.
</verse><verse>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
</verse><verse>Now Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <supplied>his</supplied> journey, sat thus on the well: <supplied>and</supplied> it was about the sixth hour.
</verse><verse>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <jesus>Give me to drink. </jesus></verse><verse>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
</verse><verse>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto her, <jesus>If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. </jesus></verse><verse>The woman saith unto him, Sir,
thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
</verse><verse>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto her, <jesus>Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well
of water springing up into everlasting life. </jesus></verse><verse>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto her, <jesus>Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </jesus></verse><verse>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <jesus>Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For thou hast had five husbands; and he
whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </jesus></verse><verse>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
</verse><verse>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto her, <jesus>Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>God <supplied>is</supplied> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
<supplied>him</supplied> in spirit and in truth. </jesus></verse><verse>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto her, <jesus>I that speak unto thee am <supplied>he.</supplied>
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
</verse><verse>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
</verse><verse>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
</verse><verse>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
</verse><verse>But he said unto them, <jesus>I have meat to eat that ye know not of. </jesus></verse><verse>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <supplied>ought</supplied> to eat?
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <supplied>then</supplied> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the
fields; for they are white already to harvest. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And herein is that saying true,
One soweth, and another reapeth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
</verse><verse>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
</verse><verse>And many more believed because of his own word;
</verse><verse>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <supplied>him</supplied> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
</verse><verse>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
</verse><verse>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
</verse><verse>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
</verse><verse>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus unto him, <jesus>Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. </jesus></verse><verse>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>Go thy way; thy son liveth.</jesus> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
</verse><verse>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <supplied>him,</supplied> saying, Thy son liveth.
</verse><verse>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
</verse><verse>So the father knew that <supplied>it was</supplied> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, <jesus>Thy son liveth:</jesus> and himself believed, and his whole house.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> again the second miracle <supplied>that</supplied> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
