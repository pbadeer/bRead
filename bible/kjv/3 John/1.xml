      <verse>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
</verse><verse>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
</verse><verse>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
</verse><verse>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
</verse><verse>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
</verse><verse>Because that for his name&#x2019;s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
</verse><verse>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <supplied>them</supplied> out of
the church.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
</verse><verse>Demetrius hath good report of all <supplied>men,</supplied> and of the truth itself: yea, and we <supplied>also</supplied> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
</verse><verse>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace <supplied>be</supplied> to thee. <supplied>Our</supplied> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
