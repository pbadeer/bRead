      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</verse><verse>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

</verse><verse>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that <supplied>is</supplied> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:
</verse><verse>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
</verse><verse>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, <supplied>that</supplied> the tabernacle was reared up.
</verse><verse>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.
</verse><verse>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:
</verse><verse>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
</verse><verse>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
</verse><verse>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:
</verse><verse>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he set up the hanging <supplied>at</supplied> the door of the tabernacle.

      </verse>
      <verse>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash <supplied>withal. </supplied></verse><verse>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:
</verse><verse>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.
</verse><verse>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
</verse><verse>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
</verse><verse>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
</verse><verse>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
</verse><verse>For the cloud of the LORD <supplied>was</supplied> upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
