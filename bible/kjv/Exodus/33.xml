      <verse>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, <supplied>and</supplied> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give
it:
</verse><verse>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
</verse><verse>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou <supplied>art</supplied> a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
</verse><verse>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to
do unto thee.
</verse><verse>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
</verse><verse>And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, which <supplied>was</supplied> without the camp.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <supplied>that</supplied> all the people rose up, and stood every man <supplied>at</supplied> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <supplied>at</supplied> the door of the tabernacle, and <supplied>the</supplied> LORD talked with Moses.
</verse><verse>And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <supplied>at</supplied> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <supplied>in</supplied> his tent door.
</verse><verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
</verse><verse>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <supplied>is</supplied> thy people.
</verse><verse>And he said, My presence shall go <supplied>with thee,</supplied> and I will give thee rest.
</verse><verse>And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <supplied>with me,</supplied> carry us not up hence.
</verse><verse>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <supplied>is it</supplied> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <supplied>are</supplied> upon the face of the earth.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
</verse><verse>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
</verse><verse>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
</verse><verse>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said, Behold, <supplied>there is</supplied> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
</verse><verse>And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
