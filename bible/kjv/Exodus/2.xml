      <verse>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <supplied>to wife</supplied> a daughter of Levi.
</verse><verse>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <supplied>was a</supplied> goodly <supplied>child,</supplied> she hid him three months.
</verse><verse>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <supplied>it</supplied> in the flags by the river&#x2019;s brink.
</verse><verse>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <supplied>herself</supplied> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river&#x2019;s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
</verse><verse>And when she had opened <supplied>it,</supplied> she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <supplied>is one</supplied> of the Hebrews&#x2019; children.
</verse><verse>Then said his sister to Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child&#x2019;s mother.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <supplied>thee</supplied> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
</verse><verse>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

      <verse>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
</verse><verse>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <supplied>there was</supplied> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
</verse><verse>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
</verse><verse>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
</verse><verse>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
</verse><verse>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <supplied>water,</supplied> and filled the troughs to water their father&#x2019;s flock.
</verse><verse>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
</verse><verse>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <supplied>is it that</supplied> ye are come so soon to day?
</verse><verse>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <supplied>water</supplied> enough for us, and watered the flock.
</verse><verse>And he said unto his daughters, And where <supplied>is</supplied> he? why <supplied>is</supplied> it <supplied>that</supplied> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
</verse><verse>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
</verse><verse>And she bare <supplied>him</supplied> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
</verse><verse>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
</verse><verse>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <supplied>them.</supplied>
