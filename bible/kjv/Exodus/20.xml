      <verse>And God spake all these words, saying,
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness <supplied>of any thing</supplied> that <supplied>is</supplied> in heaven above, or that <supplied>is</supplied> in the earth beneath, or that <supplied>is</supplied> in the water under the earth:
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God <supplied>am</supplied> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <supplied>generation</supplied> of them that hate me;
</verse><verse>And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
</verse><verse>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
</verse><verse>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
</verse><verse>But the seventh day <supplied>is</supplied> the sabbath of the LORD thy God: <supplied>in it</supplied> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that <supplied>is</supplied> within thy
gates:
</verse><verse>For <supplied>in</supplied> six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them <supplied>is,</supplied> and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not kill.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not commit adultery.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not steal.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#x2019;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#x2019;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that <supplied>is</supplied> thy neighbour&#x2019;s.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw <supplied>it,</supplied> they removed, and stood afar off.
</verse><verse>And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
</verse><verse>And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
</verse><verse>And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God <supplied>was.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
</verse><verse>Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
</verse><verse>And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
</verse><verse>Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
     
      </verse>
