      <jesus>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy
patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast
not fainted. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Nevertheless I have <supplied>somewhat</supplied> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee
quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

      <jesus>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <supplied>I know</supplied> the blasphemy
of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <supplied>are</supplied> the synagogue of Satan. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <supplied>some</supplied> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

      <jesus>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <supplied>even</supplied> where Satan’s seat <supplied>is:</supplied> and thou holdest
fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <supplied>was</supplied> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold
the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which
thing I hate. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I
give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <supplied>it.</supplied>

      <jesus>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <supplied>are</supplied> like fine brass; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy works, and charity, and service,
and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <supplied>to be</supplied> more than the first. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and
to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of
you according to your works. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But
that which ye have <supplied>already</supplied> hold fast till I come. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of
a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I will give him the morning star. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
