      <jesus>And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Be watchful, and
strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come
on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that
overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
saith unto the churches.

      <jesus>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy
works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are
Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,
and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <supplied>which is</supplied> new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and <supplied>I will write upon him</supplied> my new name.

      <jesus>And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
thou wert cold or hot. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not
that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <supplied>that</supplied> the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
