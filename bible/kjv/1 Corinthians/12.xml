      <verse>Now concerning spiritual <supplied>gifts,</supplied> brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
</verse><verse>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <supplied>that</supplied> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
</verse><verse>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
</verse><verse>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
</verse><verse>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
</verse><verse>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
</verse><verse>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
</verse><verse>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
</verse><verse>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <supplied>divers</supplied> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
</verse><verse>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
</verse><verse>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <supplied>is</supplied> Christ.
</verse><verse>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <supplied>we be</supplied> Jews or Gentiles, whether <supplied>we be</supplied> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
</verse><verse>For the body is not one member, but many.
</verse><verse>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
</verse><verse>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
</verse><verse>If the whole body <supplied>were</supplied> an eye, where <supplied>were</supplied> the hearing? If the whole <supplied>were</supplied> hearing, where <supplied>were</supplied> the smelling?
</verse><verse>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
</verse><verse>And if they were all one member, where <supplied>were</supplied> the body?
</verse><verse>But now <supplied>are they</supplied> many members, yet but one body.
</verse><verse>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
</verse><verse>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
</verse><verse>And those <supplied>members</supplied> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <supplied>parts</supplied> have more abundant comeliness.
</verse><verse>For our comely <supplied>parts</supplied> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <supplied>part</supplied> which lacked:
</verse><verse>That there should be no schism in the body; but <supplied>that</supplied> the members should have the same care one for another.
</verse><verse>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
</verse><verse>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
</verse><verse>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
</verse><verse><supplied>Are</supplied> all apostles? <supplied>are</supplied> all prophets? <supplied>are</supplied> all teachers? <supplied>are</supplied> all workers of miracles?
</verse><verse>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
</verse><verse>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
