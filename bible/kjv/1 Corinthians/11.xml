      <verse>Be ye followers of me, even as I also <supplied>am</supplied> of Christ.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <supplied>them</supplied> to you.
</verse><verse>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <supplied>is</supplied> the man; and the head of Christ <supplied>is</supplied> God.
</verse><verse>Every man praying or prophesying, having <supplied>his</supplied> head covered, dishonoureth his head.
</verse><verse>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <supplied>her</supplied> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
</verse><verse>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
</verse><verse>For a man indeed ought not to cover <supplied>his</supplied> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
</verse><verse>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
</verse><verse>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
</verse><verse>For this cause ought the woman to have power on <supplied>her</supplied> head because of the angels.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
</verse><verse>For as the woman <supplied>is</supplied> of the man, even so <supplied>is</supplied> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
</verse><verse>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
</verse><verse>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
</verse><verse>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <supplied>her</supplied> hair is given her for a covering.
</verse><verse>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now in this that I declare <supplied>unto you</supplied> I praise <supplied>you</supplied> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
</verse><verse>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
</verse><verse>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
</verse><verse>When ye come together therefore into one place, <supplied>this</supplied> is not to eat the Lord&#x2019;s supper.
</verse><verse>For in eating every one taketh before <supplied>other</supplied> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
</verse><verse>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <supplied>you</supplied> not.
</verse><verse>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <supplied>same</supplied> night in which he was betrayed took bread:
</verse><verse>And when he had given thanks, he brake <supplied>it,</supplied> and said, <jesus>Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. </jesus></verse><verse>After the same manner also <supplied>he took</supplied> the cup, when he had supped, saying,
<jesus>This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <supplied>it,</supplied> in remembrance of me. </jesus></verse><verse>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink <supplied>this</supplied> cup, ye do shew the Lord&#x2019;s death till he come.
</verse><verse>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
</verse><verse>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <supplied>that</supplied> bread, and drink of <supplied>that</supplied> cup.
</verse><verse>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord&#x2019;s body.
</verse><verse>For this cause many <supplied>are</supplied> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
</verse><verse>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
</verse><verse>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
</verse><verse>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
