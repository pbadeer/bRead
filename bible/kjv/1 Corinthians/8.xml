      <verse>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
</verse><verse>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
</verse><verse>But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
</verse><verse>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol <supplied>is</supplied> nothing in the world, and that <supplied>there is</supplied> none other God but one.
</verse><verse>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
</verse><verse>But to us <supplied>there is but</supplied> one God, the Father, of whom <supplied>are</supplied> all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom <supplied>are</supplied> all things, and we by him.
</verse><verse>Howbeit <supplied>there is</supplied> not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat <supplied>it</supplied> as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
</verse><verse>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
</verse><verse>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
</verse><verse>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol&#x2019;s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
</verse><verse>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
</verse><verse>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
