      <verse>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
</verse><verse>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
</verse><verse>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
</verse><verse>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
</verse><verse>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
</verse><verse>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
</verse><verse>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <supplied>suffer yourselves to</supplied> be defrauded?
</verse><verse>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <supplied>your</supplied> brethren.
</verse><verse>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
</verse><verse>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
</verse><verse>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
</verse><verse>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <supplied>is</supplied> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
</verse><verse>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
</verse><verse>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <supplied>them</supplied> the members of an harlot? God forbid.
</verse><verse>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
</verse><verse>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
</verse><verse>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
</verse><verse>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <supplied>which is</supplied> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
</verse><verse>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&#x2019;s.
