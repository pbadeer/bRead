      <verse>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
</verse><verse>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
</verse><verse>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man&#x2019;s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
</verse><verse>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
</verse><verse>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
</verse><verse>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <supplied>to</supplied> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <supplied>of men</supplied> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against
another.
</verse><verse>For who maketh thee to differ <supplied>from another?</supplied> and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <supplied>it,</supplied> why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <supplied>it? </supplied></verse><verse>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye
have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
</verse><verse>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
</verse><verse>We <supplied>are</supplied> fools for Christ&#x2019;s sake, but ye <supplied>are</supplied> wise in Christ; we <supplied>are</supplied> weak, but ye <supplied>are</supplied> strong; ye <supplied>are</supplied> honourable, but we <supplied>are</supplied> despised.
</verse><verse>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
</verse><verse>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
</verse><verse>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <supplied>and are</supplied> the offscouring of all things unto this day.
</verse><verse>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <supplied>you. </supplied></verse><verse>For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet <supplied>have ye</supplied> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
</verse><verse>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
</verse><verse>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
</verse><verse>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
</verse><verse>For the kingdom of God <supplied>is</supplied> not in word, but in power.
</verse><verse>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <supplied>in</supplied> the spirit of meekness?
