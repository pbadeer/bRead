      <verse>It is reported commonly <supplied>that there is</supplied> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father&#x2019;s wife.
</verse><verse>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
</verse><verse>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <supplied>concerning</supplied> him that hath so done this deed,
</verse><verse>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
</verse><verse>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
</verse><verse>Your glorying <supplied>is</supplied> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
</verse><verse>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
</verse><verse>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <supplied>bread</supplied> of sincerity and truth.
</verse><verse>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
</verse><verse>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
</verse><verse>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
</verse><verse>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
</verse><verse>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
