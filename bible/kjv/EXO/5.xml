      <verse>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said, Who <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
</verse><verse>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
</verse><verse>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now <supplied>are</supplied> many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
</verse><verse>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
</verse><verse>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
</verse><verse>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish <supplied>ought</supplied> thereof: for they <supplied>be</supplied> idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go <supplied>and</supplied> sacrifice to our God.
</verse><verse>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
</verse><verse>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
</verse><verse>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
</verse><verse>And the taskmasters hasted <supplied>them,</supplied> saying, Fulfil your works, <supplied>your</supplied> daily tasks, as when there was straw.
</verse><verse>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, <supplied>and</supplied> demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
</verse><verse>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants <supplied>are</supplied> beaten; but the fault <supplied>is</supplied> in thine own people.
</verse><verse>But he said, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> idle, <supplied>ye are</supplied> idle: therefore ye say, Let us go <supplied>and</supplied> do sacrifice to the LORD.
</verse><verse>Go therefore now, <supplied>and</supplied> work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
</verse><verse>And the officers of the children of Israel did see <supplied>that</supplied> they <supplied>were</supplied> in evil <supplied>case,</supplied> after it was said, Ye shall not minish <supplied>ought</supplied> from your bricks of your daily task.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
</verse><verse>And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
</verse><verse>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou <supplied>so</supplied> evil entreated this people? why <supplied>is</supplied> it <supplied>that</supplied> thou hast sent me?
</verse><verse>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
