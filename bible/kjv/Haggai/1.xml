</verse><verse>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD&#x2019;S house should be built.
</verse><verse>Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
</verse><verse><supplied>Is it</supplied> time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house <supplied>lie</supplied> waste?
</verse><verse>Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
</verse><verse>Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages <supplied>to put it</supplied> into a bag with holes.
