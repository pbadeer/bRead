</verse><verse>And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years <supplied>for</supplied> a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;
</verse><verse>So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with <supplied>their</supplied> buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
</verse><verse>And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such <supplied>is</supplied> our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
