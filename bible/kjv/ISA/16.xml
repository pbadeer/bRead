<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="ISA" n="16">
      <verse>Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
</verse><verse>For it shall be, <supplied>that,</supplied> as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
</verse><verse>Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.
</verse><verse>Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
</verse><verse>And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>We have heard of the pride of Moab; <supplied>he is</supplied> very proud: <supplied>even</supplied> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: <supplied>but</supplied> his lies <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> so.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely <supplied>they are</supplied> stricken.
</verse><verse>For the fields of Heshbon languish, <supplied>and</supplied> the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come <supplied>even</supplied> unto Jazer, they wandered <supplied>through</supplied> the wilderness: her branches are
stretched out, they are gone over the sea.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
</verse><verse>And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in <supplied>their</supplied> presses; I have made <supplied>their vintage</supplied>
shouting to cease.
</verse><verse>Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.
</verse><verse>But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant <supplied>shall be</supplied> very small <supplied>and</supplied> feeble.
