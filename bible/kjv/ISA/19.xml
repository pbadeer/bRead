      <verse>The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
</verse><verse>And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, <supplied>and</supplied> kingdom against kingdom.
</verse><verse>And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.

</verse><verse>The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no <supplied>more. </supplied></verse><verse>The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament,
and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
</verse><verse>Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.
</verse><verse>And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices <supplied>and</supplied> ponds for fish.

      <verse>Surely the princes of Zoan <supplied>are</supplied> fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I <supplied>am</supplied> the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
