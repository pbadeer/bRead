<chapter translation="KJV" testament="New" book="1PE" n="2">
      <verse>Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
</verse><verse>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
</verse><verse>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <supplied>is</supplied> gracious.
</verse><verse>To whom coming, <supplied>as unto</supplied> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <supplied>and</supplied> precious,
</verse><verse>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
</verse><verse>Unto you therefore which believe <supplied>he is</supplied> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
</verse><verse>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <supplied>even to them</supplied> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
</verse><verse>But ye <supplied>are</supplied> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
</verse><verse>Which in time past <supplied>were</supplied> not a people, but <supplied>are</supplied> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Dearly beloved, I beseech <supplied>you</supplied> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
</verse><verse>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by <supplied>your</supplied> good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
</verse><verse>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
</verse><verse>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
</verse><verse>As free, and not using <supplied>your</supplied> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
</verse><verse>Honour all <supplied>men.</supplied> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
</verse><verse>Servants, <supplied>be</supplied> subject to <supplied>your</supplied> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
</verse><verse>For this <supplied>is</supplied> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
</verse><verse>For what glory <supplied>is it,</supplied> if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <supplied>for it,</supplied> ye take it patiently, this <supplied>is</supplied> acceptable with God.
</verse><verse>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
</verse><verse>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
</verse><verse>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <supplied>himself</supplied> to him that judgeth righteously:
</verse><verse>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
</verse><verse>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
