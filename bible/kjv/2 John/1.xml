      <verse>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
</verse><verse>For the truth&#x2019;s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
</verse><verse>Grace be with you, mercy, <supplied>and</supplied> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
</verse><verse>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
</verse><verse>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
</verse><verse>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
</verse><verse>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
</verse><verse>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
</verse><verse>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <supplied>your</supplied> house, neither bid him God speed:
</verse><verse>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Having many things to write unto you, I would not <supplied>write</supplied> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
</verse><verse>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
