      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
</verse><verse>When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or a bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <supplied>like</supplied> the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <supplied>when</supplied> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <supplied>be</supplied> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <supplied>is</supplied> a plague of leprosy: and the priest
shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
</verse><verse>If the bright spot <supplied>be</supplied> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <supplied>be</supplied> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <supplied>him that hath</supplied> the plague seven days:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <supplied>and</supplied> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the plague <supplied>be</supplied> somewhat dark, <supplied>and</supplied> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <supplied>is but</supplied> a scab: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.
</verse><verse>But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:
</verse><verse>And <supplied>if</supplied> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> a leprosy.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
</verse><verse>And the priest shall see <supplied>him:</supplied> and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the rising <supplied>be</supplied> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <supplied>there be</supplied> quick raw flesh in the rising;
</verse><verse>It <supplied>is</supplied> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean.
</verse><verse>And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <supplied>him that hath</supplied> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <supplied>him</supplied> clean <supplied>that hath</supplied> the plague: it is all turned white: he <supplied>is</supplied> clean.
</verse><verse>But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
</verse><verse>And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <supplied>for</supplied> the raw flesh <supplied>is</supplied> unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> a leprosy.
</verse><verse>Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
</verse><verse>And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <supplied>him</supplied> clean <supplied>that hath</supplied> the plague: he <supplied>is</supplied> clean.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The flesh also, in which, <supplied>even</supplied> in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,
</verse><verse>And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;
</verse><verse>And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <supplied>be</supplied> in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
</verse><verse>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <supplied>there be</supplied> no white hairs therein, and <supplied>if</supplied> it <supplied>be</supplied> not lower than the skin, but <supplied>be</supplied> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
</verse><verse>And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> a plague.
</verse><verse>But if the bright spot stay in his place, <supplied>and</supplied> spread not, it <supplied>is</supplied> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Or if there be <supplied>any</supplied> flesh, in the skin whereof <supplied>there is</supplied> a hot burning, and the quick <supplied>flesh</supplied> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it <supplied>be in</supplied> sight deeper than the skin; it <supplied>is</supplied> a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce
him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> the plague of leprosy.
</verse><verse>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <supplied>there be</supplied> no white hair in the bright spot, and it <supplied>be</supplied> no lower than the <supplied>other</supplied> skin, but <supplied>be</supplied> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <supplied>and</supplied> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> the plague of leprosy.
</verse><verse>And if the bright spot stay in his place, <supplied>and</supplied> spread not in the skin, but it <supplied>be</supplied> somewhat dark; it <supplied>is</supplied> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <supplied>is</supplied> an inflammation of the
burning.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it <supplied>be</supplied> in sight deeper than the skin; <supplied>and there be</supplied> in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <supplied>is</supplied> a dry scall, <supplied>even</supplied> a leprosy
upon the head or beard.
</verse><verse>And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it <supplied>be</supplied> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <supplied>that there is</supplied> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <supplied>him that hath</supplied> the plague of the scall seven
days:
</verse><verse>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <supplied>be</supplied> not in sight deeper than the skin;
</verse><verse>He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <supplied>him that hath</supplied> the scall seven days more:
</verse><verse>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <supplied>be</supplied> in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and
be clean.
</verse><verse>But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean.
</verse><verse>But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <supplied>that</supplied> there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <supplied>is</supplied> clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <supplied>even</supplied> white bright spots;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <supplied>be</supplied> darkish white; it <supplied>is</supplied> a freckled spot <supplied>that</supplied> groweth in the skin; he <supplied>is</supplied> clean.
</verse><verse>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <supplied>is</supplied> bald; <supplied>yet is</supplied> he clean.
</verse><verse>And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he <supplied>is</supplied> forehead bald: <supplied>yet is</supplied> he clean.
</verse><verse>And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it <supplied>is</supplied> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the rising of the sore <supplied>be</supplied> white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
</verse><verse>He is a leprous man, he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <supplied>is</supplied> in his head.
</verse><verse>And the leper in whom the plague <supplied>is,</supplied> his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
</verse><verse>All the days wherein the plague <supplied>shall be</supplied> in him he shall be defiled; he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp <supplied>shall</supplied> his habitation <supplied>be.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, <supplied>whether it be</supplied> a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
</verse><verse>Whether <supplied>it be</supplied> in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
</verse><verse>And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <supplied>is</supplied> a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up <supplied>it that hath</supplied> the plague seven days:
</verse><verse>And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, <supplied>or</supplied> in any work that is made of skin; the plague <supplied>is</supplied> a fretting leprosy; it <supplied>is</supplied>
unclean.
</verse><verse>He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it <supplied>is</supplied> a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
</verse><verse>And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
</verse><verse>Then the priest shall command that they wash <supplied>the thing</supplied> wherein the plague <supplied>is,</supplied> and he shall shut it up seven days more:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, <supplied>if</supplied> the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it <supplied>is</supplied> unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it <supplied>is</supplied> fret inward,
<supplied>whether</supplied> it <supplied>be</supplied> bare within or without.
</verse><verse>And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague <supplied>be</supplied> somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
</verse><verse>And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <supplied>is</supplied> a spreading <supplied>plague:</supplied> thou shalt burn that wherein the plague <supplied>is</supplied> with fire.
</verse><verse>And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin <supplied>it be,</supplied> which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
