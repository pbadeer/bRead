      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</verse><verse>Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <supplied>he be</supplied> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <supplied>any</supplied> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the
land shall stone him with stones.
</verse><verse>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
</verse><verse>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:
</verse><verse>Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD your God.
</verse><verse>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD which sanctify you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the man that committeth adultery with <supplied>another</supplied> man&#x2019;s wife, <supplied>even he</supplied> that committeth adultery with his neighbour&#x2019;s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
</verse><verse>And the man that lieth with his father&#x2019;s wife hath uncovered his father&#x2019;s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon them.
</verse><verse>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon them.
</verse><verse>If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon them.
</verse><verse>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it <supplied>is</supplied> wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
</verse><verse>And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
</verse><verse>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon them.
</verse><verse>And if a man shall take his sister, his father&#x2019;s daughter, or his mother&#x2019;s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it <supplied>is</supplied> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his
sister&#x2019;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
</verse><verse>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother&#x2019;s sister, nor of thy father&#x2019;s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
</verse><verse>And if a man shall lie with his uncle&#x2019;s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle&#x2019;s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
</verse><verse>And if a man shall take his brother&#x2019;s wife, it <supplied>is</supplied> an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother&#x2019;s nakedness; they shall be childless.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.
</verse><verse>And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
</verse><verse>But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD your God, which have separated you from <supplied>other</supplied> people.
</verse><verse>Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
have separated from you as unclean.
</verse><verse>And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD <supplied>am</supplied> holy, and have severed you from <supplied>other</supplied> people, that ye should be mine.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon them.
