      <verse>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan <supplied>by</supplied> Jericho.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
</verse><verse>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they <supplied>were</supplied> many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
</verse><verse>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all <supplied>that are</supplied> round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor <supplied>was</supplied> king of the Moabites at that time.
</verse><verse>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the
earth, and they abide over against me:
</verse><verse>Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they <supplied>are</supplied> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, <supplied>that</supplied> we may smite them, and <supplied>that</supplied> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest
<supplied>is</supplied> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
</verse><verse>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
</verse><verse>And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <supplied>are</supplied> these with thee?
</verse><verse>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <supplied>saying, </supplied></verse><verse>Behold, <supplied>there is</supplied> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall
be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
</verse><verse>And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <supplied>are</supplied> blessed.
</verse><verse>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
</verse><verse>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
</verse><verse>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
</verse><verse>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
</verse><verse>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
</verse><verse>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.
</verse><verse>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <supplied>and</supplied> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
</verse><verse>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <supplied>were</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
</verse><verse>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <supplied>being</supplied> on this side, and a wall on that side.
</verse><verse>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
</verse><verse>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <supplied>was</supplied> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
</verse><verse>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
</verse><verse>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
</verse><verse>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
</verse><verse>And the ass said unto Balaam, <supplied>Am</supplied> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <supplied>I was</supplied> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
</verse><verse>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
</verse><verse>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <supplied>thy</supplied> way is perverse before me:
</verse><verse>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
</verse><verse>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
</verse><verse>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <supplied>is</supplied> in the border of Arnon, which <supplied>is</supplied> in the utmost coast.
</verse><verse>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
</verse><verse>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
</verse><verse>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.
</verse><verse>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <supplied>were</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <supplied>part</supplied> of the people.
