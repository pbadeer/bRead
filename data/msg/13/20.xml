<verse>That spring, the time when kings usually go off to war, Joab led the army out and ravaged the Ammonites. He then set siege to Rabbah. David meanwhile was back in Jerusalem. Joab hit Rabbah hard and left it in ruins.</verse>
<verse>David took the crown off the head of their king. Its weight was found to be a talent of gold and set with a precious stone. It was placed on David's head. He hauled great quantities of loot from the city</verse>
<verse>and put the people to hard labor with saws and picks and axes. This is what he did to all the Ammonites. Then David and his army returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>Later war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. That was the time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai of the clan of giants. The Philistines had to eat crow.</verse>
<verse>In another war with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite whose spear was like a ship's boom.</verse>
<verse>And then there was the war at Gath that featured a hulking giant who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot--yet another from the clan of giants.</verse>
<verse>When he mocked Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.</verse>
<verse>These came from the clan of giants and were killed by David and his men.</verse>
