<verse>Bezalel made the Chest using acacia wood: He made it three and three-quarters feet long and two and a quarter feet wide and deep.</verse>
<verse>He covered it inside and out with a veneer of pure gold and made a molding of gold all around it.</verse>
<verse>He cast four gold rings and attached them to its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other.</verse>
<verse>He made poles from acacia wood, covered them with a veneer of gold,</verse>
<verse>and inserted the poles for carrying the Chest into the rings on the sides.</verse>
<verse>Next he made a lid of pure gold for the Chest, an Atonement-Cover, three and three-quarters feet long and two and a quarter feet wide.</verse>
<verse>He sculpted two winged angel-cherubim out of hammered gold for the ends of the Atonement-Cover,</verse>
<verse>one angel at one end, one angel at the other. He made them of one piece with the Atonement-Cover.</verse>
<verse>The angels had outstretched wings and appeared to hover over the Atonement-Cover, facing one another but looking down on the Atonement-Cover.</verse>
<verse>He made the Table from acacia wood. He made it three feet long, one and a half feet wide and two and a quarter feet high.</verse>
<verse>He covered it with a veneer of pure gold and made a molding of gold all around it.</verse>
<verse>He made a border a handbreadth wide all around it and a rim of gold for the border.</verse>
<verse>He cast four rings of gold for it and attached the rings to the four legs</verse>
<verse>parallel to the table top. They will serve as holders for the poles used to carry the Table.</verse>
<verse>He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with a veneer of gold. They will be used to carry the Table.</verse>
<verse>Out of pure gold he made the utensils for the Table: its plates, bowls, jars, and jugs used for pouring.</verse>
<verse>He made a Lampstand of pure hammered gold, making its stem and branches, cups, calyxes, and petals all of one piece.</verse>
<verse>It had six branches, three from one side and three from the other;</verse>
<verse>three cups shaped like almond blossoms with calyxes and petals on one branch, three on the next, and so on--the same for all six branches.</verse>
<verse>On the main stem of the Lampstand, there were four cups shaped like almonds, with calyxes and petals,</verse>
<verse>a calyx extending from under each pair of the six branches.</verse>
<verse>The entire Lampstand with its calyxes and stems was fashioned from one piece of hammered pure gold.</verse>
<verse>He made seven of these lamps with their candle snuffers, all out of pure gold.</verse>
<verse>He used a seventy-five-pound brick of pure gold to make the Lampstand and its accessories.</verse>
<verse>He made an Altar for burning incense from acacia wood. He made it a foot and a half square and three feet high, with its horns of one piece with it.</verse>
<verse>He covered it with a veneer of pure gold, its top, sides, and horns, and made a gold molding around it</verse>
<verse>with two rings of gold beneath the molding. He placed the rings on the two opposing sides to serve as holders for poles by which it will be carried.</verse>
<verse>He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with a veneer of gold.</verse>
<verse>He also prepared with the art of a perfumer the holy anointing oil and the pure aromatic incense.</verse>
