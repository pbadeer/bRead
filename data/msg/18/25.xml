<verse>Bildad the Shuhite again attacked Job:</verse>
<verse>"God is sovereign, God is fearsome--everything in the cosmos fits and works in his plan.</verse>
<verse>Can anyone count his angel armies? Is there any place where his light doesn't shine?</verse>
<verse>How can a mere mortal presume to stand up to God? How can an ordinary person pretend to be guiltless?</verse>
<verse>Why, even the moon has its flaws, even the stars aren't perfect in God's eyes,</verse>
<verse>So how much less, plain men and women--slugs and maggots by comparison!" Job's Defense God Sets a Boundary Between Light and Darkness</verse>
