<verse>Job replied:</verse>
<verse>"I'm not letting up--I'm standing my ground. My complaint is legitimate. God has no right to treat me like this--it isn't fair!</verse>
<verse>If I knew where on earth to find him, I'd go straight to him.</verse>
<verse>I'd lay my case before him face-to-face, give him all my arguments firsthand.</verse>
<verse>I'd find out exactly what he's thinking, discover what's going on in his head.</verse>
<verse>Do you think he'd dismiss me or bully me? No, he'd take me seriously.</verse>
<verse>He'd see a straight--living man standing before him; my Judge would acquit me for good of all charges.</verse>
<verse>"I travel East looking for him--I find no one; then West, but not a trace;</verse>
<verse>I go North, but he's hidden his tracks; then South, but not even a glimpse.</verse>
<verse>"But he knows where I am and what I've done. He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I'll pass the test with honors.</verse>
<verse>I've followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, not once swerving from his way.</verse>
<verse>I've obeyed every word he's spoken, and not just obeyed his advice--I've treasured it.</verse>
<verse>"But he is singular and sovereign. Who can argue with him? He does what he wants, when he wants to.</verse>
<verse>He'll complete in detail what he's decided about me, and whatever else he determines to do.</verse>
<verse>Is it any wonder that I dread meeting him? Whenever I think about it, I get scared all over again.</verse>
<verse>God makes my heart sink! God Almighty gives me the shudders!</verse>
<verse>I'm completely in the dark, I can't see my hand in front of my face.</verse>
