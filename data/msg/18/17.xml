<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="17">
<verse>"My spirit is broken, my days used up, my grave dug and waiting.</verse>
<verse>See how these mockers close in on me? How long do I have to put up with their insolence?</verse>
<verse>"O God, pledge your support for me. Give it to me in writing, with your signature. You're the only one who can do it!</verse>
<verse>These people are so useless! You know firsthand how stupid they can be. You wouldn't let them have the last word, would you?</verse>
<verse>Those who betray their own friends leave a legacy of abuse to their children.</verse>
<verse>"God, you've made me the talk of the town--people spit in my face;</verse>
<verse>I can hardly see from crying so much; I'm nothing but skin and bones.</verse>
<verse>Decent people can't believe what they're seeing; the good-hearted wake up and insist I've given up on God.</verse>
<verse>"But principled people hold tight, keep a firm grip on life, sure that their clean, pure hands will get stronger and stronger!</verse>
<verse>"Maybe you'd all like to start over, to try it again, the bunch of you. So far I haven't come across one scrap of wisdom in anything you've said.</verse>
<verse>My life's about over. All my plans are smashed, all my hopes are snuffed out--</verse>
<verse>My hope that night would turn into day, my hope that dawn was about to break.</verse>
<verse>If all I have to look forward to is a home in the graveyard, if my only hope for comfort is a well-built coffin,</verse>
<verse>If a family reunion means going six feet under, and the only family that shows up is worms,</verse>
<verse>Do you call that hope? Who on earth could find any hope in that?</verse>
<verse>No. If hope and I are to be buried together, I suppose you'll all come to the double funeral!" HKBildad's Second AttackHK Plunged from Light into Darkness</verse>
