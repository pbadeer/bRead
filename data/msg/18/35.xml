<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="35">
<verse>Elihu lit into Job again:</verse>
<verse>"Does this kind of thing make any sense? First you say, "I'm perfectly innocent before God.'</verse>
<verse>And then you say, "It doesn't make a bit of difference whether I've sinned or not.'</verse>
<verse>"Well, I'm going to show you that you don't know what you're talking about, neither you nor your friends.</verse>
<verse>Look up at the sky. Take a long hard look. See those clouds towering above you?</verse>
<verse>If you sin, what difference could that make to God? No matter how much you sin, will it matter to him?</verse>
<verse>Even if you're good, what would God get out of that? Do you think he's dependent on your accomplishments?</verse>
<verse>The only ones who care whether you're good or bad are your family and friends and neighbors. God's not dependent on your behavior.</verse>
<verse>"When times get bad, people cry out for help. They cry for relief from being kicked around,</verse>
<verse>But never give God a thought when things go well, when God puts spontaneous songs in their hearts,</verse>
<verse>When God sets out the entire creation as a science classroom, using birds and beasts to teach wisdom.</verse>
<verse>People are arrogantly indifferent to God--until, of course, they're in trouble, and then God is indifferent to them.</verse>
<verse>There's nothing behind such prayers except panic; the Almighty pays them no mind.</verse>
<verse>So why would he notice you just because you say you're tired of waiting to be heard,</verse>
<verse>Or waiting for him to get good and angry and do something about the world's problems?</verse>
<verse>"Job, you talk sheer nonsense--nonstop nonsense!"</verse>
