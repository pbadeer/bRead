<verse>Bildad from Shuhah chimed in:</verse>
<verse>"How monotonous these word games are getting! Get serious! We need to get down to business.</verse>
<verse>Why do you treat your friends like slow-witted animals? You look down on us as if we don't know anything.</verse>
<verse>Why are you working yourself up like this? Do you want the world redesigned to suit you? Should reality be suspended to accommodate you?</verse>
<verse>"Here's the rule: The light of the wicked is put out. Their flame dies down and is extinguished.</verse>
<verse>Their house goes dark--every lamp in the place goes out.</verse>
<verse>Their strong strides weaken, falter; they stumble into their own traps.</verse>
<verse>They get all tangled up in their own red tape,</verse>
<verse>Their feet are grabbed and caught, their necks in a noose.</verse>
<verse>They trip on ropes they've hidden, and fall into pits they've dug themselves.</verse>
<verse>Terrors come at them from all sides. They run helter-skelter.</verse>
<verse>The hungry grave is ready to gobble them up for supper,</verse>
<verse>To lay them out for a gourmet meal, a treat for ravenous Death.</verse>
<verse>They are snatched from their home sweet home and marched straight to the death house.</verse>
<verse>Their lives go up in smoke; acid rain soaks their ruins.</verse>
<verse>Their roots rot and their branches wither.</verse>
<verse>They'll never again be remembered--nameless in unmarked graves.</verse>
<verse>They are plunged from light into darkness, banished from the world.</verse>
<verse>And they leave empty-handed--not one single child--nothing to show for their life on this earth.</verse>
<verse>Westerners are aghast at their fate, easterners are horrified:</verse>
<verse>"Oh no! So this is what happens to perverse people. This is how the God--ignorant end up!'" HKJob Answers BildadHK I Call for Help and No One Bothers</verse>
