<verse>Job answered:</verse>
<verse>"Well, you've certainly been a great help to a helpless man! You came to the rescue just in the nick of time!</verse>
<verse>What wonderful advice you've given to a mixed-up man! What amazing insights you've provided!</verse>
<verse>Where in the world did you learn all this? How did you become so inspired?</verse>
<verse>"All the buried dead are in torment, and all who've been drowned in the deep, deep sea.</verse>
<verse>Hell is ripped open before God, graveyards dug up and exposed.</verse>
<verse>He spreads the skies over unformed space, hangs the earth out in empty space.</verse>
<verse>He pours water into cumulus cloud-bags and the bags don't burst.</verse>
<verse>He makes the moon wax and wane, putting it through its phases.</verse>
<verse>He draws the horizon out over the ocean, sets a boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
<verse>Thunder crashes and rumbles in the skies. Listen! It's God raising his voice!</verse>
<verse>By his power he stills sea storms, by his wisdom he tames sea monsters.</verse>
<verse>With one breath he clears the sky, with one finger he crushes the sea serpent.</verse>
<verse>And this is only the beginning, a mere whisper of his rule. Whatever would we do if he really raised his voice!"</verse>
