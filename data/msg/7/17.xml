<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Judges" book-id="7" n="17">
<verse>There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Micah.</verse>
<verse>He said to his mother, "Remember that 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you? I overheard you when you pronounced your curse. Well, I have the money; I stole it. But now I've brought it back to you." His mother said, "GOD bless you, my son!"</verse>
<verse>As he returned the 1,100 silver pieces to his mother, she said, "I had totally consecrated this money to GOD for my son to make a statue, a cast god."</verse>
<verse>Then she took 200 pieces of the silver and gave it to a sculptor and he cast them into the form of a god.</verse>
<verse>This man, Micah, had a private chapel. He had made an ephod and some teraphim-idols and had ordained one of his sons to be his priest.</verse>
<verse>In those days there was no king in Israel. People did whatever they felt like doing. [JC]</verse>
<verse>Meanwhile there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah and from a family of Judah. He was a Levite but was a stranger there.</verse>
<verse>He left that town, Bethlehem in Judah, seeking his fortune. He got as far as the hill country of Ephraim and showed up at Micah's house.</verse>
<verse>Micah asked him, "So where are you from?" He said, "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I'm on the road, looking for a place to settle down."</verse>
<verse>Micah said, "Stay here with me. Be my father and priest. I'll pay you ten pieces of silver a year, whatever clothes you need, and your meals."</verse>
<verse>The Levite agreed and moved in with Micah. The young man fit right in and became one of the family.</verse>
<verse>Micah appointed the young Levite as his priest. This all took place in Micah's home.</verse>
<verse>Micah said, "Now I know that GOD will make things go well for me--why, I've got a Levite for a priest!" [JC]</verse>
