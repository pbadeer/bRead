<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="Philemon" book_id="57" n="1">
<verse>I, Paul, am a prisoner for the sake of Christ, here with my brother Timothy. I write this letter to you, Philemon, my good friend and companion in this work--</verse>
<verse>also to our sister Apphia, to Archippus, a real trooper, and to the church that meets in your house.</verse>
<verse>God's best to you! Christ's blessings on you!</verse>
<verse>Every time your name comes up in my prayers, I say, "Oh, thank you, God!</verse>
<verse>" I keep hearing of the love and faith you have for the Master Jesus, which brims over to other Christians.</verse>
<verse>And I keep praying that this faith we hold in common keeps showing up in the good things we do, and that people recognize Christ in all of it.</verse>
<verse>Friend, you have no idea how good your love makes me feel, doubly so when I see your hospitality to fellow believers.</verse>
<verse>In line with all this I have a favor to ask of you. As Christ's ambassador and now a prisoner for him, I wouldn't hesitate to command this if I thought it necessary,</verse>
<verse>but I'd rather make it a personal request.</verse>
<verse>While here in jail, I've fathered a child, so to speak. And here he is, hand-carrying this letter--Onesimus!</verse>
<verse>He was useless to you before; now he's useful to both of us.</verse>
<verse>I'm sending him back to you, but it feels like I'm cutting off my right arm in doing so.</verse>
<verse>I wanted in the worst way to keep him here as your stand-in to help out while I'm in jail for the Message.</verse>
<verse>But I didn't want to do anything behind your back, make you do a good deed that you hadn't willingly agreed to.</verse>
<verse>Maybe it's all for the best that you lost him for a while. You're getting him back now for good--</verse>
<verse>and no mere slave this time, but a true Christian brother! That's what he was to me--he'll be even more than that to you.</verse>
<verse>So if you still consider me a comrade-in-arms, welcome him back as you would me.</verse>
<verse>If he damaged anything or owes you anything, chalk it up to my account.</verse>
<verse>This is my personal signature--Paul-and I stand behind it. (I don't need to remind you, do I, that you owe your very life to me?)</verse>
<verse>Do me this big favor, friend. You'll be doing it for Christ, but it will also do my heart good.</verse>
<verse>I know you well enough to know you will. You'll probably go far beyond what I've written.</verse>
<verse>And by the way, get a room ready for me. Because of your prayers, I fully expect to be your guest again.</verse>
<verse>Epaphras, my cellmate in the cause of Christ, says hello.</verse>
<verse>Also my coworkers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke.</verse>
<verse>All the best to you from the Master, Jesus Christ!</verse>
