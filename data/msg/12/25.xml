<verse>The revolt dates from the ninth year and tenth month of Zedekiah's reign. Nebuchadnezzar set out for Jerusalem immediately with a full army. He set up camp and sealed off the city by building siege mounds around it.</verse>
<verse>The city was under siege for nineteen months (until the eleventh year of Zedekiah).</verse>
<verse>By the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was so bad that there wasn't so much as a crumb of bread for anyone.</verse>
<verse>Then there was a breakthrough. At night, under cover of darkness, the entire army escaped through an opening in the wall (it was the gate between the two walls above the King's Garden). They slipped through the lines of the Babylonians who surrounded the city and headed for the Jordan on the Arabah Valley road.</verse>
<verse>But the Babylonians were in pursuit of the king and they caught up with him in the Plains of Jericho. By then Zedekiah's army had deserted and was scattered.</verse>
<verse>The Babylonians took Zedekiah prisoner and marched him off to the king of Babylon at Riblah, then tried and sentenced him on the spot.</verse>
<verse>Zedekiah's sons were executed right before his eyes; the summary murder of his sons was the last thing he saw, for they then blinded him. Securely handcuffed, he was hauled off to Babylon.</verse>
<verse>In the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, on the seventh day of the fifth month, Nebuzaradan, the king of Babylon's chief deputy, arrived in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>He burned The Temple of GOD to the ground, went on to the royal palace, and then finished off the city--burned the whole place down.</verse>
<verse>He put the Babylonian troops he had with him to work knocking down the city walls.</verse>
<verse>Finally, he rounded up everyone left in the city, including those who had earlier deserted to the king of Babylon, and took them off into exile.</verse>
<verse>He left a few poor dirt farmers behind to tend the vineyards and what was left of the fields.</verse>
<verse>The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the bronze washstands, and the huge bronze basin (the Sea) that were in The Temple of GOD and hauled the bronze off to Babylon.</verse>
<verse>They also took the various bronze-crafted liturgical accessories used in the services of Temple worship,</verse>
<verse>as well as the gold and silver censers and sprinkling bowls. The king's deputy didn't miss a thing--he took every scrap of precious metal he could find.</verse>
<verse>The amount of bronze they got from the two pillars, the Sea, and all the washstands that Solomon had made for The Temple of GOD was enormous--they couldn't weigh it all!</verse>
<verse>Each pillar stood twenty-seven feet high, plus another four and a half feet for an ornate capital of bronze filigree and decorative fruit.</verse>
<verse>The king's deputy took a number of special prisoners: Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the associate priest, three wardens,</verse>
<verse>the chief remaining army officer, five of the king's counselors, the accountant, the chief recruiting officer for the army, and sixty men of standing from among the people.</verse>
<verse>Nebuzaradan the king's deputy marched them all off to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</verse>
<verse>And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon killed the lot of them in cold blood. Judah went into exile, orphaned from her land.</verse>
<verse>Regarding the common people who were left behind in Judah, this: Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as their governor.</verse>
<verse>When veteran army officers among the people heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Among them were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and some of their followers.</verse>
<verse>Gedaliah assured the officers and their men, giving them his word, "Don't be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Go back to your farms and families and respect the king of Babylon. Trust me, everything is going to be all right."</verse>
<verse>Some time later--it was in the seventh month--Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama (he had royal blood in him), came back with ten men and killed Gedaliah, the traitor Jews, and the Babylonian officials who were stationed at Mizpah--a bloody massacre.</verse>
<verse>But then, afraid of what the Babylonians would do, they all took off for Egypt, leaders and people, small and great.</verse>
<verse>When Jehoiachin king of Judah had been in exile for thirty-seven years, Evil-Merodach became king in Babylon and let Jehoiachin out of prison. This release took place on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.</verse>
<verse>The king treated him most courteously and gave him preferential treatment beyond anything experienced by the other political prisoners held in Babylon.</verse>
<verse>Jehoiachin took off his prison garb and for the rest of his life ate his meals in company with the king.</verse>
<verse>The king provided everything he needed to live comfortably.</verse>
