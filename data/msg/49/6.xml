<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="Ephesians" book-id="49" n="6">
<verse>Children, do what your parents tell you. This is only right.</verse>
<verse>"Honor your father and mother" is the first commandment that has a promise attached to it, namely,</verse>
<verse>"so you will live well and have a long life."</verse>
<verse>Fathers, don't exasperate your children by coming down hard on them. Take them by the hand and lead them in the way of the Master.</verse>
<verse>Servants, respectfully obey your earthly masters but always with an eye to obeying the real master, Christ.</verse>
<verse>Don't just do what you have to do to get by, but work heartily, as Christ's servants doing what God wants you to do.</verse>
<verse>And work with a smile on your face, always keeping in mind that no matter who happens to be giving the orders, you're really serving God.</verse>
<verse>Good work will get you good pay from the Master, regardless of whether you are slave or free.</verse>
<verse>Masters, it's the same with you. No abuse, please, and no threats. You and your servants are both under the same Master in heaven. He makes no distinction between you and them.</verse>
<verse>And that about wraps it up. God is strong, and he wants you strong.</verse>
<verse>So take everything the Master has set out for you, well-made weapons of the best materials. And put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the Devil throws your way.</verse>
<verse>This is no afternoon athletic contest that we'll walk away from and forget about in a couple of hours. This is for keeps, a life-or-death fight to the finish against the Devil and all his angels.</verse>
<verse>Be prepared. You're up against far more than you can handle on your own. Take all the help you can get, every weapon God has issued, so that when it's all over but the shouting you'll still be on your feet.</verse>
<verse>Truth, righteousness,</verse>
<verse>peace,</verse>
<verse>faith,</verse>
<verse>and salvation are more than words. Learn how to apply them. You'll need them throughout your life. God's Word is an indispensable weapon.</verse>
<verse>In the same way, prayer is essential in this ongoing warfare. Pray hard and long. Pray for your brothers and sisters. Keep your eyes open. Keep each other's spirits up so that no one falls behind or drops out.</verse>
<verse>And don't forget to pray for me. Pray that I'll know what to say and have the courage to say it at the right time, telling the mystery to one and all, the Message that I,</verse>
<verse>jailbird preacher that I am, am responsible for getting out.</verse>
<verse>Tychicus, my good friend here, will tell you what I'm doing and how things are going with me. He is certainly a dependable servant of the Master!</verse>
<verse>I've sent him not only to tell you about us but to cheer you on in your faith.</verse>
<verse>Good-bye, friends. Love mixed with faith be yours from God the Father and from the Master, Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>Pure grace and nothing but grace be with all who love our Master, Jesus Christ.</verse>
