<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book-id="26" n="15">
<verse>GOD's Message came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, how would you compare the wood of a vine with the branches of any tree you'd find in the forest?</verse>
<verse>Is vine wood ever used to make anything? Is it used to make pegs to hang things from?</verse>
<verse>"I don't think so. At best it's good for fuel. Look at it: a flimsy piece of vine, thrown in the fire and then rescued--the ends burned off and the middle charred. Now is it good for anything?</verse>
<verse>"Hardly. When it was whole it wasn't good for anything. Half-burned is no improvement. What's it good for?</verse>
<verse>"So here's the Message of GOD, the Master: Like the wood of the vine I selected from among the trees of the forest and used as fuel for the fire, just so I'll treat those who live in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>I am dead set against them. Even though at one time they got out of the fire charred, the fire's going to burn them up. When I take my stand against them, you'll realize that I am GOD.</verse>
<verse>I'll turn this country into a wilderness because they've been faithless." Decree of GOD, the Master.</verse>
