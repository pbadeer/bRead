<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Deuteronomy" book_id="5" n="34">
<verse>Moses climbed from the Plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the peak of Pisgah facing Jericho. GOD showed him all the land from Gilead to Dan,</verse>
<verse>all Naphtali, Ephraim, and Manasseh; all Judah reaching to the Mediterranean Sea;</verse>
<verse>the Negev and the plains which encircle Jericho, City of Palms, as far south as Zoar.</verse>
<verse>Then and there GOD said to him, "This is the land I promised to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with the words "I will give it to your descendants.' I've let you see it with your own eyes. There it is. But you're not going to go in."</verse>
<verse>Moses died there in the land of Moab, Moses the servant of GOD, just as GOD said.</verse>
<verse>God buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor. No one knows his burial site to this very day.</verse>
<verse>Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eyesight was sharp; he still walked with a spring in his step.</verse>
<verse>The People of Israel wept for Moses in the Plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.</verse>
<verse>Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. The People of Israel listened obediently to him and did the same as when GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>No prophet has risen since in Israel like Moses, whom GOD knew face-to-face.</verse>
<verse>Never since has there been anything like the signs and miracle-wonders that GOD sent him to do in Egypt, to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to all his land</verse>
<verse>-nothing to compare with that all-powerful hand of his and all the great and terrible things Moses did as every eye in Israel watched.</verse>
