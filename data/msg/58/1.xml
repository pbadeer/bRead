<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="Hebrews" book-id="58" n="1">
<verse>Going through a long line of prophets, God has been addressing our ancestors in different ways for centuries.</verse>
<verse>Recently he spoke to us directly through his Son. By his Son, God created the world in the beginning, and it will all belong to the Son at the end.</verse>
<verse>This Son perfectly mirrors God, and is stamped with God's nature. He holds everything together by what he says--powerful words! After he finished the sacrifice for sins, the Son took his honored place high in the heavens right alongside God,</verse>
<verse>far higher than any angel in rank and rule.</verse>
<verse>Did God ever say to an angel, "You're my Son; today I celebrate you"? Or, "I'm his Father, he's my Son"?</verse>
<verse>When he presents his honored Son to the world, he says, "All angels must worship him."</verse>
<verse>Regarding angels he says, The messengers are winds, the servants are tongues of fire.</verse>
<verse>But he says to the Son, You're God, and on the throne for good; your rule makes everything right.</verse>
<verse>You love it when things are right; you hate it when things are wrong. That is why God, your God, poured fragrant oil on your head, Marking you out as king, far above your dear companions.</verse>
<verse>And again to the Son, You, Master, started it all, laid earth's foundations, then crafted the stars in the sky.</verse>
<verse>Earth and sky will wear out, but not you; they become threadbare like an old coat;</verse>
<verse>You'll fold them up like a worn-out cloak, and lay them away on the shelf. But you'll stay the same, year after year; you'll never fade, you'll never wear out.</verse>
<verse>And did he ever say anything like this to an angel? Sit alongside me here on my throne Until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.</verse>
<verse>Isn't it obvious that all angels are sent to help out with those lined up to receive salvation?</verse>
