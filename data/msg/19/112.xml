<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="112">
<verse>Hallelujah! Blessed man, blessed woman, who fear GOD, Who cherish and relish his commandments,</verse>
<verse>Their children robust on the earth, And the homes of the upright--how blessed!</verse>
<verse>Their houses brim with wealth And a generosity that never runs dry.</verse>
<verse>Sunrise breaks through the darkness for good people--God's grace and mercy and justice!</verse>
<verse>The good person is generous and lends lavishly;</verse>
<verse>No shuffling or stumbling around for this one, But a sterling and solid and lasting reputation.</verse>
<verse>Unfazed by rumor and gossip, Heart ready, trusting in GOD,</verse>
<verse>Spirit firm, unperturbed, Ever blessed, relaxed among enemies,</verse>
<verse>They lavish gifts on the poor--A generosity that goes on, and on, and on. An honored life! A beautiful life!</verse>
<verse>Someone wicked takes one look and rages, Blusters away but ends up speechless. There's nothing to the dreams of the wicked. Nothing. he</verse>
