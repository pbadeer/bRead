<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="142">
<verse>I cry out loudly to GOD, loudly I plead with GOD for mercy.</verse>
<verse>I spill out all my complaints before him, and spell out my troubles in detail:</verse>
<verse>"As I sink in despair, my spirit ebbing away, you know how I'm feeling, Know the danger I'm in, the traps hidden in my path.</verse>
<verse>Look right, look left--there's not a soul who cares what happens! I'm up against it, with no exit--bereft, left alone.</verse>
<verse>I cry out, GOD, call out: "You're my last chance, my only hope for life!'</verse>
<verse>Oh listen, please listen; I've never been this low. Rescue me from those who are hunting me down; I'm no match for them.</verse>
<verse>Get me out of this dungeon so I can thank you in public. Your people will form a circle around me and you'll bring me showers of blessing!"</verse>
