<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="76">
<verse>God is well-known in Judah; in Israel, he's a household name.</verse>
<verse>He keeps a house in Salem, his own suite of rooms in Zion.</verse>
<verse>That's where, using arrows for kindling, he made a bonfire of weapons of war.</verse>
<verse>Oh, how bright you shine! Outshining their huge piles of loot!</verse>
<verse>The warriors were plundered and left there impotent. And now there's nothing to them, nothing to show for their swagger and threats.</verse>
<verse>Your sudden roar, God of Jacob, knocked the wind out of horse and rider.</verse>
<verse>Fierce you are, and fearsome! Who can stand up to your rising anger?</verse>
<verse>From heaven you thunder judgment; earth falls to her knees and holds her breath.</verse>
<verse>God stands tall and makes things right, he saves all the wretched on earth.</verse>
<verse>Instead of smoldering rage--God--praise! All that sputtering rage--now a garland for God!</verse>
<verse>Do for GOD what you said you'd do--he is, after all, your God. Let everyone in town bring offerings to the One Who Watches our every move.</verse>
<verse>Nobody gets by with anything, no one plays fast and loose with him. An Asaph psalm</verse>
