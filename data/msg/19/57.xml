<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="57">
<verse>Be good to me, God--and now! I've run to you for dear life. I'm hiding out under your wings until the hurricane blows over.</verse>
<verse>I call out to High God, the God who holds me together.</verse>
<verse>He sends orders from heaven and saves me, he humiliates those who kick me around. God delivers generous love, he makes good on his word.</verse>
<verse>I find myself in a pride of lions who are wild for a taste of human flesh; Their teeth are lances and arrows, their tongues are sharp daggers.</verse>
<verse>Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!</verse>
<verse>They booby trapped my path; I thought I was dead and done for. They dug a mantrap to catch me, and fell in headlong themselves.</verse>
<verse>I'm ready, God, so ready, ready from head to toe, Ready to sing, ready to raise a tune:</verse>
<verse>"Wake up, soul! Wake up, harp! wake up, lute! Wake up, you sleepyhead sun!"</verse>
<verse>I'm thanking you, GOD, out loud in the streets, singing your praises in town and country.</verse>
<verse>The deeper your love, the higher it goes; every cloud is a flag to your faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!</verse>
