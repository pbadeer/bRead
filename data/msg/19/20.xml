<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="20">
<verse>GOD answer you on the day you crash, The name God--of-Jacob put you out of harm's reach,</verse>
<verse>Send reinforcements from Holy Hill, Dispatch from Zion fresh supplies,</verse>
<verse>Exclaim over your offerings, Celebrate your sacrifices,</verse>
<verse>Give you what your heart desires, Accomplish your plans.</verse>
<verse>When you win, we plan to raise the roof and lead the parade with our banners. May all your wishes come true!</verse>
<verse>That clinches it--help's coming, an answer's on the way, everything's going to work out.</verse>
<verse>See those people polishing their chariots, and those others grooming their horses? But we're making garlands for GOD our God.</verse>
<verse>The chariots will rust, those horses pull up lame--and we'll be on our feet, standing tall.</verse>
<verse>Make the king a winner, GOD; the day we call, give us your answer.</verse>
