<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="147">
<verse>Hallelujah! It's a good thing to sing praise to our God; praise is beautiful, praise is fitting.</verse>
<verse>GOD's the one who rebuilds Jerusalem, who regathers Israel's scattered exiles.</verse>
<verse>He heals the heartbroken and bandages their wounds.</verse>
<verse>He counts the stars and assigns each a name.</verse>
<verse>Our Lord is great, with limitless strength; we'll never comprehend what he knows and does</verse>
<verse>GOD puts the fallen on their feet again and pushes the wicked into the ditch.</verse>
<verse>Sing to GOD a thanksgiving hymn, play music on your instruments to God,</verse>
<verse>Who fills the sky with clouds, preparing rain for the earth, Then turning the mountains green with grass,</verse>
<verse>feeding both cattle and crows.</verse>
<verse>He's not impressed with horsepower; the size of our muscles means little to him.</verse>
<verse>Those who fear GOD get GOD's attention; they can depend on his strength.</verse>
<verse>Jerusalem, worship GOD! Zion, praise your God!</verse>
<verse>He made your city secure, he blessed your children among you.</verse>
<verse>He keeps the peace at your borders, he puts the best bread on your tables.</verse>
<verse>He launches his promises earthward--how swift and sure they come!</verse>
<verse>He spreads snow like a white fleece, he scatters frost like ashes,</verse>
<verse>He broadcasts hail like birdseed--who can survive his winter?</verse>
<verse>Then he gives the command and it all melts; he breathes on winter--suddenly it's spring!</verse>
<verse>He speaks the same way to Jacob, speaks words that work to Israel.</verse>
<verse>He never did this to the other nations; they never heard such commands. Hallelujah! al</verse>
