<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="131">
<verse>GOD, I'm not trying to rule the roost, I don't want to be king of the mountain. I haven't meddled where I have no business or fantasized grandiose plans.</verse>
<verse>I've kept my feet on the ground, I've cultivated a quiet heart. Like a baby content in its mother's arms, my soul is a baby content.</verse>
<verse>Wait, Israel, for GOD. Wait with hope. Hope now; hope always!</verse>
