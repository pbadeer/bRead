<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="132">
<verse>O GOD, remember David, remember all his troubles!</verse>
<verse>And remember how he promised GOD, made a vow to the Strong God of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>"I'm not going home, and I'm not going to bed,</verse>
<verse>I'm not going to sleep, not even take time to rest,</verse>
<verse>Until I find a home for GOD, a house for the Strong God of Jacob."</verse>
<verse>Remember how we got the news in Ephrathah, learned all about it at Jaar Meadows?</verse>
<verse>We shouted, "Let's go to the shrine dedication! Let's worship at God's own footstool!"</verse>
<verse>Up, GOD, enjoy your new place of quiet repose, you and your mighty covenant ark;</verse>
<verse>Get your priests all dressed up in justice; prompt your worshipers to sing this prayer:</verse>
<verse>"Honor your servant David; don't disdain your anointed one."</verse>
<verse>GOD gave David his word, he won't back out on this promise: "One of your sons I will set on your throne;</verse>
<verse>If your sons stay true to my Covenant and learn to live the way I teach them, Their sons will continue the line--always a son to sit on your throne.</verse>
<verse>Yes--I, GOD, chose Zion, the place I wanted for my shrine;</verse>
<verse>This will always be my home; this is what I want, and I'm here for good.</verse>
<verse>I'll shower blessings on the pilgrims who come here, and give supper to those who arrive hungry;</verse>
<verse>I'll dress my priests in salvation clothes; the holy people will sing their hearts out!</verse>
<verse>Oh, I'll make the place radiant for David! I'll fill it with light for my anointed!</verse>
<verse>I'll dress his enemies in dirty rags, but I'll make his crown sparkle with splendor."</verse>
