<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="125">
<verse>Those who trust in GOD are like Zion Mountain: Nothing can move it, a rock-solid mountain you can always depend on.</verse>
<verse>Mountains encircle Jerusalem, and GOD encircles his people--always has and always will.</verse>
<verse>The fist of the wicked will never violate What is due the righteous, provoking wrongful violence.</verse>
<verse>Be good to your good people, GOD, to those whose hearts are right!</verse>
<verse>GOD will round up the backsliders, corral them with the incorrigibles. Peace over Israel!</verse>
