<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="149">
<verse>Hallelujah! Sing to GOD a brand-new song, praise him in the company of all who love him.</verse>
<verse>Let all Israel celebrate their Sovereign Creator, Zion's children exult in their King.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise his name in dance; strike up the band and make great music!</verse>
<verse>And why? Because GOD delights in his people, festoons plain folk with salvation garlands!</verse>
<verse>Let true lovers break out in praise, sing out from wherever they're sitting,</verse>
<verse>Shout the high praises of God, brandish their swords in the wild sword--dance--</verse>
<verse>A portent of vengeance on the God--defying nations, a signal that punishment's coming,</verse>
<verse>Their kings chained and hauled off to jail, their leaders behind bars for good,</verse>
<verse>The judgment on them carried out to the letter -and all who love God in the seat of honor! Hallelujah! al</verse>
