<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="126">
<verse>It seemed like a dream, too good to be true, when GOD returned Zion's exiles.</verse>
<verse>We laughed, we sang, we couldn't believe our good fortune. We were the talk of the nations--"GOD was wonderful to them!"</verse>
<verse>GOD was wonderful to us; we are one happy people.</verse>
<verse>And now, GOD, do it again--bring rains to our drought-stricken lives</verse>
<verse>So those who planted their crops in despair will shout hurrahs at the harvest,</verse>
<verse>So those who went off with heavy hearts will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing.</verse>
