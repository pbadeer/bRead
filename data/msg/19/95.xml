<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="95">
<verse>Come, let's shout praises to GOD, raise the roof for the Rock who saved us!</verse>
<verse>Let's march into his presence singing praises, lifting the rafters with our hymns!</verse>
<verse>And why? Because GOD is the best, High King over all the gods.</verse>
<verse>In one hand he holds deep caves and caverns, in the other hand grasps the high mountains.</verse>
<verse>He made Ocean--he owns it! His hands sculpted Earth!</verse>
<verse>So come, let us worship: bow before him, on your knees before GOD, who made us!</verse>
<verse>Oh yes, he's our God, and we're the people he pastures, the flock he feeds. Drop everything and listen, listen as he speaks:</verse>
<verse>"Don't turn a deaf ear as in the Bitter Uprising, As on the day of the Wilderness Test,</verse>
<verse>when your ancestors turned and put me to the test.</verse>
<verse>For forty years they watched me at work among them, as over and over they tried my patience. And I was provoked--oh, was I provoked! "Can't they keep their minds on God for five minutes? Do they simply refuse to walk down my road?'</verse>
<verse>Exasperated, I exploded, "They'll never get where they're headed, never be able to sit down and rest.'"</verse>
