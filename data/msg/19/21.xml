<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="21">
<verse>Your strength, GOD, is the king's strength. Helped, he's hollering Hosannas.</verse>
<verse>You gave him exactly what he wanted; you didn't hold back.</verse>
<verse>You filled his arms with gifts; you gave him a right royal welcome.</verse>
<verse>He wanted a good life; you gave it to him, and then made it a long life as a bonus.</verse>
<verse>You lifted him high and bright as a cumulus cloud, then dressed him in rainbow colors.</verse>
<verse>You pile blessings on him; you make him glad when you smile.</verse>
<verse>Is it any wonder the king loves GOD? that he's sticking with the Best?</verse>
<verse>With a fistful of enemies in one hand and a fistful of haters in the other,</verse>
<verse>You radiate with such brilliance that they cringe as before a furnace. Now the furnace swallows them whole, the fire eats them alive!</verse>
<verse>You purge the earth of their progeny, you wipe the slate clean.</verse>
<verse>All their evil schemes, the plots they cook up, have fizzled--every one.</verse>
<verse>You sent them packing; they couldn't face you.</verse>
<verse>Show your strength, GOD, so no one can miss it. We are out singing the good news!</verse>
