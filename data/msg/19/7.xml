<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="7">
<verse>GOD! GOD! I am running to you for dear life; the chase is wild.</verse>
<verse>If they catch me, I'm finished: ripped to shreds by foes fierce as lions, dragged into the forest and left unlooked for, unremembered.</verse>
<verse>GOD, if I've done what they say--</verse>
<verse>betrayed my friends, ripped off my enemies--If my hands are really that dirty,</verse>
<verse>let them get me, walk all over me, leave me flat on my face in the dirt.</verse>
<verse>Stand up, GOD; pit your holy fury against my furious enemies. Wake up, God.</verse>
<verse>My accusers have packed the courtroom; it's judgment time.</verse>
<verse>Take your place on the bench, reach for your gavel, throw out the false charges against me. I'm ready, confident in your verdict: "Innocent."</verse>
<verse>Close the book on Evil, GOD, but publish your mandate for us. You get us ready for life: you probe for our soft spots, you knock off our rough edges.</verse>
<verse>And I'm feeling so fit, so safe: made right, kept right.</verse>
<verse>God in solemn honor does things right, but his nerves are sandpapered raw. Nobody gets by with anything.</verse>
<verse>God is already in action--Sword honed on his whetstone, bow strung, arrow on the string,</verse>
<verse>Lethal weapons in hand, each arrow a flaming missile.</verse>
<verse>Look at that guy! He had sex with sin, he's pregnant with evil. Oh, look! He's having the baby--a Lie-Baby!</verse>
<verse>See that man shoveling day after day, digging, then concealing, his man-trap down that lonely stretch of road? Go back and look again--you'll see him in it headfirst, legs waving in the breeze.</verse>
<verse>That's what happens: mischief backfires; violence boomerangs.</verse>
<verse>I'm thanking God, who makes things right. I'm singing the fame of heaven-high GOD.</verse>
