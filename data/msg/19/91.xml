<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="91">
<verse>You who sit down in the High God's presence, spend the night in Shaddai's shadow,</verse>
<verse>Say this: "GOD, you're my refuge. I trust in you and I'm safe!"</verse>
<verse>That's right--he rescues you from hidden traps, shields you from deadly hazards.</verse>
<verse>His huge outstretched arms protect you--under them you're perfectly safe; his arms fend off all harm.</verse>
<verse>Fear nothing--not wild wolves in the night, not flying arrows in the day,</verse>
<verse>Not disease that prowls through the darkness, not disaster that erupts at high noon.</verse>
<verse>Even though others succumb all around, drop like flies right and left, no harm will even graze you.</verse>
<verse>You'll stand untouched, watch it all from a distance, watch the wicked turn into corpses.</verse>
<verse>Yes, because GOD's your refuge, the High God your very own home,</verse>
<verse>Evil can't get close to you, harm can't get through the door.</verse>
<verse>He ordered his angels to guard you wherever you go.</verse>
<verse>If you stumble, they'll catch you; their job is to keep you from falling.</verse>
<verse>You'll walk unharmed among lions and snakes, and kick young lions and serpents from the path.</verse>
<verse>"If you'll hold on to me for dear life," says GOD, "I'll get you out of any trouble. I'll give you the best of care if you'll only get to know and trust me.</verse>
<verse>Call me and I'll answer, be at your side in bad times; I'll rescue you, then throw you a party.</verse>
<verse>I'll give you a long life, give you a long drink of salvation!" A Sabbath song</verse>
