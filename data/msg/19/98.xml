<verse>Shout your praises to GOD, everybody! Let loose and sing! Strike up the band!</verse>

<verse>Feature trumpets and big trombones, Fill the air with praises to King GOD.</verse>
<verse>Let the sea and its fish give a round of applause, With everything living on earth joining in.</verse>
<verse>Let ocean breakers call out, "Encore!" And mountains harmonize the finale--</verse>
<verse>A tribute to GOD when he comes, When he comes to set the earth right. He'll straighten out the whole world, He'll put the world right, and everyone in it.</verse>
