<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="90">
<verse>God, it seems you've been our home forever;</verse>
<verse>long before the mountains were born, Long before you brought earth itself to birth, from "once upon a time" to "kingdom come"--you are God.</verse>
<verse>So don't return us to mud, saying, "Back to where you came from!"</verse>
<verse>Patience! You've got all the time in the world--whether a thousand years or a day, it's all the same to you.</verse>
<verse>Are we no more to you than a wispy dream, no more than a blade of grass</verse>
<verse>That springs up gloriously with the rising sun and is cut down without a second thought?</verse>
<verse>Your anger is far and away too much for us; we're at the end of our rope.</verse>
<verse>You keep track of all our sins; every misdeed since we were children is entered in your books.</verse>
<verse>All we can remember is that frown on your face. Is that all we're ever going to get?</verse>
<verse>We live for seventy years or so (with luck we might make it to eighty), And what do we have to show for it? Trouble. Toil and trouble and a marker in the graveyard.</verse>
<verse>Who can make sense of such rage, such anger against the very ones who fear you?</verse>
<verse>Oh! Teach us to live well! Teach us to live wisely and well!</verse>
<verse>Come back, GOD-how long do we have to wait?- and treat your servants with kindness for a change.</verse>
<verse>Surprise us with love at daybreak; then we'll skip and dance all the day long.</verse>
<verse>Make up for the bad times with some good times; we've seen enough evil to last a lifetime.</verse>
<verse>Let your servants see what you're best at--the ways you rule and bless your children.</verse>
<verse>And let the loveliness of our Lord, our God, rest on us, confirming the work that we do. Oh, yes. Affirm the work that we do!</verse>
