<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="46">
<verse>God is a safe place to hide, ready to help when we need him.</verse>
<verse>We stand fearless at the cliff-edge of doom, courageous in seastorm and earthquake,</verse>
<verse>Before the rush and roar of oceans, the tremors that shift mountains. Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us.</verse>
<verse>River fountains splash joy, cooling God's city, this sacred haunt of the Most High.</verse>
<verse>God lives here, the streets are safe, God at your service from crack of dawn.</verse>
<verse>Godless nations rant and rave, kings and kingdoms threaten, but Earth does anything he says.</verse>
<verse>Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us.</verse>
<verse>Attention, all! See the marvels of GOD! He plants flowers and trees all over the earth,</verse>
<verse>Bans war from pole to pole, breaks all the weapons across his knee.</verse>
<verse>"Step out of the traffic! Take a long, loving look at me, your High God, above politics, above everything."</verse>
<verse>Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us. A psalm of the sons of Korah</verse>
