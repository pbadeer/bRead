<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="16">
<verse>Keep me safe, O God, I've run for dear life to you.</verse>
<verse>I say to GOD, "Be my Lord!" Without you, nothing makes sense.</verse>
<verse>And these God--chosen lives all around--what splendid friends they make!</verse>
<verse>Don't just go shopping for a god. Gods are not for sale. I swear I'll never treat god-names like brand-names.</verse>
<verse>My choice is you, GOD, first and only. And now I find I'm your choice!</verse>
<verse>You set me up with a house and yard. And then you made me your heir!</verse>
<verse>The wise counsel GOD gives when I'm awake is confirmed by my sleeping heart.</verse>
<verse>Day and night I'll stick with GOD; I've got a good thing going and I'm not letting go.</verse>
<verse>I'm happy from the inside out, and from the outside in, I'm firmly formed.</verse>
<verse>You canceled my ticket to hell--that's not my destination!</verse>
<verse>Now you've got my feet on the life path, all radiant from the shining of your face. Ever since you took my hand, I'm on the right way. A David prayer</verse>
