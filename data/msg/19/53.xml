<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="53">
<verse>Bilious and bloated, they gas, "God is gone." It's poison gas--they foul themselves, they poison Rivers and skies; thistles are their cash crop.</verse>
<verse>God sticks his head out of heaven. He looks around. He's looking for someone not stupid--one man, even, God--expectant, just one God--ready woman.</verse>
<verse>He comes up empty. A string of zeros. Useless, unshepherded Sheep, taking turns pretending to be Shepherd. The ninety and nine follow the one.</verse>
<verse>Don't they know anything, all these impostors? Don't they know they can't get away with this, Treating people like a fast-food meal over which they're too busy to pray?</verse>
<verse>Night is coming for them, and nightmare--a nightmare they'll never wake up from. God will make hash of these squatters, send them packing for good.</verse>
<verse>Is there anyone around to save Israel? God turns life around. Turned-around Jacob skips rope, turned-around Israel sings laughter.</verse>
