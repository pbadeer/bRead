<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="82">
<verse>God calls the judges into his courtroom, he puts all the judges in the dock.</verse>
<verse>"Enough! You've corrupted justice long enough, you've let the wicked get away with murder.</verse>
<verse>You're here to defend the defenseless, to make sure that underdogs get a fair break;</verse>
<verse>Your job is to stand up for the powerless, and prosecute all those who exploit them."</verse>
<verse>Ignorant judges! Head-in-the-sand judges! They haven't a clue to what's going on. And now everything's falling apart, the world's coming unglued.</verse>
<verse>"I commissioned you judges, each one of you, deputies of the High God,</verse>
<verse>But you've betrayed your commission and now you're stripped of your rank, busted."</verse>
<verse>O God, give them their just deserts! You've got the whole world in your hands! An Asaph psalm</verse>
