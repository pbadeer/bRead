<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="29">
<verse>Bravo, GOD, bravo! Gods and all angels shout, "Encore!"</verse>
<verse>In awe before the glory, in awe before God's visible power. Stand at attention! Dress your best to honor him!</verse>
<verse>GOD thunders across the waters, Brilliant, his voice and his face, streaming brightness--GOD, across the flood waters.</verse>
<verse>GOD's thunder tympanic, GOD's thunder symphonic.</verse>
<verse>GOD's thunder smashes cedars, GOD topples the northern cedars.</verse>
<verse>The mountain ranges skip like spring colts, The high ridges jump like wild kid goats.</verse>
<verse>GOD's thunder spits fire.</verse>
<verse>GOD thunders, the wilderness quakes; He makes the desert of Kadesh shake.</verse>
<verse>GOD's thunder sets the oak trees dancing A wild dance, whirling; the pelting rain strips their branches. We fall to our knees--we call out, "Glory!"</verse>
<verse>Above the floodwaters is GOD's throne from which his power flows, from which he rules the world.</verse>
<verse>GOD makes his people strong. GOD gives his people peace.</verse>
