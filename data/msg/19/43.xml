<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="43">
<verse>Clear my name, God; stick up for me against these loveless, immoral people. Get me out of here, away from these lying degenerates.</verse>
<verse>I counted on you, God. Why did you walk out on me? Why am I pacing the floor, wringing my hands over these outrageous people?</verse>
<verse>Give me your lantern and compass, give me a map, So I can find my way to the sacred mountain, to the place of your presence,</verse>
<verse>To enter the place of worship, meet my exuberant God, Sing my thanks with a harp, magnificent God, my God.</verse>
<verse>Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God--soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God. A psalm of the sons of Korah</verse>
