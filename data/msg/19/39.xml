<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="39">
<verse>I'm determined to watch steps and tongue so they won't land me in trouble. I decided to hold my tongue as long as Wicked is in the room.</verse>
<verse>"Mum's the word," I said, and kept quiet. But the longer I kept silence The worse it got--</verse>
<verse>my insides got hotter and hotter. My thoughts boiled over; I spilled my guts.</verse>
<verse>"Tell me, what's going on, GOD? How long do I have to live? Give me the bad news!</verse>
<verse>You've kept me on pretty short rations; my life is string too short to be saved.</verse>
<verse>Oh! we're all puffs of air. Oh! we're all shadows in a campfire. Oh! we're just spit in the wind. We make our pile, and then we leave it.</verse>
<verse>"What am I doing in the meantime, Lord? Hoping, that's what I'm doing--hoping</verse>
<verse>You'll save me from a rebel life, save me from the contempt of dunces.</verse>
<verse>I'll say no more, I'll shut my mouth, since you, Lord, are behind all this.</verse>
<verse>But I can't take it much longer. When you put us through the fire</verse>
<verse>to purge us from our sin, our dearest idols go up in smoke. Are we also nothing but smoke?</verse>
<verse>"Ah, GOD, listen to my prayer, my cry--open your ears. Don't be callous; just look at these tears of mine. I'm a stranger here. I don't know my way--a migrant like my whole family.</verse>
<verse>Give me a break, cut me some slack before it's too late and I'm out of here."</verse>
