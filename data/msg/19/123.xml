<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="123">
<verse>I look to you, heaven-dwelling God, look up to you for help.</verse>
<verse>Like servants, alert to their master's commands, like a maiden attending her lady, We're watching and waiting, holding our breath, awaiting your word of mercy.</verse>
<verse>Mercy, GOD, mercy! We've been kicked around long enough,</verse>
<verse>Kicked in the teeth by complacent rich men, kicked when we're down by arrogant brutes.</verse>
