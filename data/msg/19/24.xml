<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="24">
<verse>GOD claims Earth and everything in it, God claims World and all who live on it.</verse>
<verse>He built it on Ocean foundations, laid it out on River girders.</verse>
<verse>Who can climb Mount GOD? Who can scale the holy north-face?</verse>
<verse>Only the clean-handed, only the pure-hearted; Men who won't cheat, women who won't seduce.</verse>
<verse>GOD is at their side; with GOD's help they make it.</verse>
<verse>This, Jacob, is what happens to God--seekers, God--questers.</verse>
<verse>Wake up, you sleepyhead city! Wake up, you sleepyhead people! King-Glory is ready to enter.</verse>
<verse>Who is this King-Glory? GOD, armed and battle-ready.</verse>
<verse>Wake up, you sleepyhead city! Wake up, you sleepyhead people! King-Glory is ready to enter.</verse>
<verse>Who is this King-Glory? GOD of the angel armies: he is King-Glory.</verse>
