<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="83">
<verse>GOD, don't shut me out; don't give me the silent treatment, O God.</verse>
<verse>Your enemies are out there whooping it up, the God--haters are living it up;</verse>
<verse>They're plotting to do your people in, conspiring to rob you of your precious ones.</verse>
<verse>"Let's wipe this nation from the face of the earth," they say; "scratch Israel's name off the books."</verse>
<verse>And now they're putting their heads together, making plans to get rid of you.</verse>
<verse>Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,</verse>
<verse>Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia and the Tyrians,</verse>
<verse>And now Assyria has joined up, Giving muscle to the gang of Lot.</verse>
<verse>Do to them what you did to Midian, to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon Brook;</verse>
<verse>They came to a bad end at Endor, nothing but dung for the garden.</verse>
<verse>Cut down their leaders as you did Oreb and Zeeb, their princes to nothings like Zebah and Zalmunna,</verse>
<verse>With their empty brags, "We're grabbing it all, grabbing God's gardens for ourselves."</verse>
<verse>My God! I've had it with them! Blow them away! Tumbleweeds in the desert waste,</verse>
<verse>charred sticks in the burned-over ground.</verse>
<verse>Knock the breath right out of them, so they're gasping</verse>
<verse>for breath, gasping, "GOD."</verse>
<verse>Bring them to the end of their rope, and leave them there dangling, helpless.</verse>
<verse>Then they'll learn your name: "GOD," the one and only High God on earth. A Korah psalm</verse>
