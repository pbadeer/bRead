<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="70">
<verse>God! Please hurry to my rescue! God, come quickly to my side!</verse>
<verse>Those who are out to get me--let them fall all over themselves. Those who relish my downfall--send them down a blind alley.</verse>
<verse>Give them a taste of their own medicine, those gossips off clucking their tongues.</verse>
<verse>Let those on the hunt for you sing and celebrate. Let all who love your saving way say over and over, "God is mighty!"</verse>
<verse>But I've lost it. I'm wasted. God--quickly, quickly! Quick to my side, quick to my rescue! GOD, don't lose a minute.</verse>
