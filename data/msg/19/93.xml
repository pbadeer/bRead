<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="93">
<verse>GOD is King, robed and ruling, GOD is robed and surging with strength. And yes, the world is firm, immovable,</verse>
<verse>Your throne ever firm--you're Eternal!</verse>
<verse>Sea storms are up, GOD, Sea storms wild and roaring, Sea storms with thunderous breakers.</verse>
<verse>Stronger than wild sea storms, Mightier than sea-storm breakers, Mighty GOD rules from High Heaven.</verse>
<verse>What you say goes--it always has. "Beauty" and "Holy" mark your palace rule, GOD, to the very end of time.</verse>
