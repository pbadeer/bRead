<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="148">
<verse>Hallelujah! Praise GOD from heaven, praise him from the mountaintops;</verse>
<verse>Praise him, all you his angels, praise him, all you his warriors,</verse>
<verse>Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, you morning stars;</verse>
<verse>Praise him, high heaven, praise him, heavenly rain clouds;</verse>
<verse>Praise, oh let them praise the name of GOD- he spoke the word, and there they were!</verse>
<verse>He set them in place from all time to eternity; He gave his orders, and that's it!</verse>
<verse>Praise GOD from earth, you sea dragons, you fathomless ocean deeps;</verse>
<verse>Fire and hail, snow and ice, hurricanes obeying his orders;</verse>
<verse>Mountains and all hills, apple orchards and cedar forests;</verse>
<verse>Wild beasts and herds of cattle, snakes, and birds in flight;</verse>
<verse>Earth's kings and all races, leaders and important people,</verse>
<verse>Robust men and women in their prime, and yes, graybeards and little children.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise the name of GOD- it's the only Name worth praising. His radiance exceeds anything in earth and sky;</verse>
<verse>he's built a monument--his very own people! Praise from all who love GOD! Israel's children, intimate friends of GOD. Hallelujah! al</verse>
