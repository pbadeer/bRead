<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="41">
<verse>Dignify those who are down on their luck; you'll feel good--that's what GOD does.</verse>
<verse>GOD looks after us all, makes us robust with life--Lucky to be in the land, we're free from enemy worries.</verse>
<verse>Whenever we're sick and in bed, GOD becomes our nurse, nurses us back to health.</verse>
<verse>I said, "GOD, be gracious! Put me together again--my sins have torn me to pieces."</verse>
<verse>My enemies are wishing the worst for me; they make bets on what day I will die.</verse>
<verse>If someone comes to see me, he mouths empty platitudes, All the while gathering gossip about me to entertain the street-corner crowd.</verse>
<verse>These "friends" who hate me whisper slanders all over town. They form committees to plan misery for me.</verse>
<verse>The rumor goes out, "He's got some dirty, deadly disease. The doctors have given up on him."</verse>
<verse>Even my best friend, the one I always told everything -he ate meals at my house all the time!- has bitten my hand.</verse>
<verse>GOD, give grace, get me up on my feet. I'll show them a thing or two.</verse>
<verse>Meanwhile, I'm sure you're on my side--no victory shouts yet from the enemy camp!</verse>
<verse>You know me inside and out, you hold me together, you never fail to stand me tall in your presence so I can look you in the eye.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is GOD, Israel's God, always, always, always. Yes. Yes. Yes. A psalm of the sons of Korah</verse>
