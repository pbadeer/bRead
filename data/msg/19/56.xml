<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="56">
<verse>Take my side, God--I'm getting kicked around, stomped on every day.</verse>
<verse>Not a day goes by but somebody beats me up; They make it their duty to beat me up.</verse>
<verse>When I get really afraid I come to you in trust.</verse>
<verse>I'm proud to praise God; fearless now, I trust in God. What can mere mortals do?</verse>
<verse>They don't let up--they smear my reputation and huddle to plot my collapse.</verse>
<verse>They gang up, sneak together through the alleys To take me by surprise, wait their chance to get me.</verse>
<verse>Pay them back in evil! Get angry, God! Down with these people!</verse>
<verse>You've kept track of my every toss and turn through the sleepless nights, Each tear entered in your ledger, each ache written in your book.</verse>
<verse>If my enemies run away, turn tail when I yell at them, Then I'll know that God is on my side.</verse>
<verse>I'm proud to praise God, proud to praise GOD.</verse>
<verse>Fearless now, I trust in God; what can mere mortals do to me?</verse>
<verse>God, you did everything you promised, and I'm thanking you with all my heart.</verse>
<verse>You pulled me from the brink of death, my feet from the cliff-edge of doom. Now I stroll at leisure with God in the sunlit fields of life.</verse>
