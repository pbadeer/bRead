<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="75">
<verse>We thank you, God, we thank you--your Name is our favorite word; your mighty works are all we talk about.</verse>
<verse>You say, "I'm calling this meeting to order, I'm ready to set things right.</verse>
<verse>When the earth goes topsy-turvy And nobody knows which end is up, I nail it all down, I put everything in place again.</verse>
<verse>I say to the smart alecks, "That's enough,' to the bullies, "Not so fast.'"</verse>
<verse>Don't raise your fist against High God. Don't raise your voice against Rock of Ages.</verse>
<verse>He's the One from east to west; from desert to mountains, he's the One.</verse>
<verse>God rules: he brings this one down to his knees, pulls that one up on her feet.</verse>
<verse>GOD has a cup in his hand, a bowl of wine, full to the brim. He draws from it and pours; it's drained to the dregs. Earth's wicked ones drink it all, drink it down to the last bitter drop!</verse>
<verse>And I'm telling the story of God Eternal, singing the praises of Jacob's God.</verse>
<verse>The fists of the wicked are bloody stumps, The arms of the righteous are lofty green branches. An Asaph psalm</verse>
