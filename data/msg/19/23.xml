<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="23">
<verse>GOD, my shepherd! I don't need a thing.</verse>
<verse>You have bedded me down in lush meadows, you find me quiet pools to drink from.</verse>
<verse>True to your word, you let me catch my breath and send me in the right direction.</verse>
<verse>Even when the way goes through Death Valley, I'm not afraid when you walk at my side. Your trusty shepherd's crook makes me feel secure.</verse>
<verse>You serve me a six-course dinner right in front of my enemies. You revive my drooping head; my cup brims with blessing.</verse>
<verse>Your beauty and love chase after me every day of my life. I'm back home in the house of GOD for the rest of my life.</verse>
