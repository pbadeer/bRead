<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="48">
<verse>GOD majestic, praise abounds in our God--city! His sacred mountain,</verse>
<verse>breathtaking in its heights--earth's joy. Zion Mountain looms in the North, city of the world-King.</verse>
<verse>God in his citadel peaks impregnable.</verse>
<verse>The kings got together, they united and came.</verse>
<verse>They took one look and shook their heads, they scattered and ran away.</verse>
<verse>They doubled up in pain like a woman having a baby.</verse>
<verse>You smashed the ships of Tarshish with a storm out of the East.</verse>
<verse>We heard about it, then we saw it with our eyes--In GOD's city of angel armies, in the city our God Set on firm foundations, firm forever.</verse>
<verse>We pondered your love--in-action, God, waiting in your temple:</verse>
<verse>Your name, God, evokes a train of Hallelujahs wherever It is spoken, near and far; your arms are heaped with goodness-in-action.</verse>
<verse>Be glad, Zion Mountain; Dance, Judah's daughters! He does what he said he'd do!</verse>
<verse>Circle Zion, take her measure, count her fortress peaks,</verse>
<verse>Gaze long at her sloping bulwark, climb her citadel heights--Then you can tell the next generation detail by detail the story of God,</verse>
<verse>Our God forever, who guides us till the end of time. A psalm of the sons of Korah</verse>
