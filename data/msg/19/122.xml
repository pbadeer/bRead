<verse>A pilgrim song of David. When they said, "Let's go to the house of GOD," my heart leaped for joy.</verse>
<verse>And now we're here, O Jerusalem, inside Jerusalem's walls!</verse>
<verse>Jerusalem, well-built city, built as a place for worship!</verse>
<verse>The city to which the tribes ascend, all GOD's tribes go up to worship, To give thanks to the name of GOD- this is what it means to be Israel.</verse>
<verse>Thrones for righteous judgment are set there, famous David-thrones.</verse>
<verse>Pray for Jerusalem's peace! Prosperity to all you Jerusalem-lovers!</verse>
<verse>Friendly insiders, get along! Hostile outsiders, keep your distance!</verse>
<verse>For the sake of my family and friends, I say it again: live in peace!</verse>
<verse>For the sake of the house of our God, GOD, I'll do my very best for you.</verse>
