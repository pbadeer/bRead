<verse>He founded Zion on the Holy Mountain--</verse>
<verse>and oh, how GOD loves his home! Loves it far better than all the homes of Jacob put together!</verse>
<verse>God's hometown--oh! everyone there is talking about you!</verse>
<verse>I name them off, those among whom I'm famous: Egypt and Babylon, also Philistia, even Tyre, along with Cush. Word's getting around; they point them out: "This one was born again here!"</verse>
<verse>The word's getting out on Zion: "Men and women, right and left, get born again in her!"</verse>
<verse>GOD registers their names in his book: "This one, this one, and this one--born again, right here."</verse>
<verse>Singers and dancers give credit to Zion: "All my springs are in you!" A Korah prayer of Heman</verse>
