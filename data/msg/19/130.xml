<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="130">
<verse>Help, GOD-the bottom has fallen out of my life! Master, hear my cry for help!</verse>
<verse>Listen hard! Open your ears! Listen to my cries for mercy.</verse>
<verse>If you, GOD, kept records on wrongdoings, who would stand a chance?</verse>
<verse>As it turns out, forgiveness is your habit, and that's why you're worshiped.</verse>
<verse>I pray to GOD-my life a prayer--and wait for what he'll say and do.</verse>
<verse>My life's on the line before God, my Lord, waiting and watching till morning, waiting and watching till morning.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, wait and watch for GOD- with GOD's arrival comes love, with GOD's arrival comes generous redemption.</verse>
<verse>No doubt about it--he'll redeem Israel, buy back Israel from captivity to sin.</verse>
