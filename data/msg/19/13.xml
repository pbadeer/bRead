<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="13">
<verse>Long enough, GOD- you've ignored me long enough. I've looked at the back of your head long enough.</verse>
<verse>Long enough I've carried this ton of trouble, lived with a stomach full of pain. Long enough my arrogant enemies have looked down their noses at me.</verse>
<verse>Take a good look at me, GOD, my God; I want to look life in the eye,</verse>
<verse>So no enemy can get the best of me or laugh when I fall on my face.</verse>
<verse>I've thrown myself headlong into your arms--I'm celebrating your rescue.</verse>
<verse>I'm singing at the top of my lungs, I'm so full of answered prayers.</verse>
