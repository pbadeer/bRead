<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="121">
<verse>I look up to the mountains; does my strength come from mountains?</verse>
<verse>No, my strength comes from GOD, who made heaven, and earth, and mountains.</verse>
<verse>He won't let you stumble, your Guardian God won't fall asleep.</verse>
<verse>Not on your life! Israel's Guardian will never doze or sleep.</verse>
<verse>GOD's your Guardian, right at your side to protect you--</verse>
<verse>Shielding you from sunstroke, sheltering you from moonstroke.</verse>
<verse>GOD guards you from every evil, he guards your very life.</verse>
<verse>He guards you when you leave and when you return, he guards you now, he guards you always. 1A pilgrim song of David When they said, "Let's go to the house of GOD," my heart leaped for joy.</verse>
