<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="138">
<verse>Thank you! Everything in me says "Thank you!" Angels listen as I sing my thanks.</verse>
<verse>I kneel in worship facing your holy temple and say it again: "Thank you!" Thank you for your love, thank you for your faithfulness; Most holy is your name, most holy is your Word.</verse>
<verse>The moment I called out, you stepped in; you made my life large with strength.</verse>
<verse>When they hear what you have to say, GOD, all earth's kings will say "Thank you."</verse>
<verse>They'll sing of what you've done: "How great the glory of GOD!"</verse>
<verse>And here's why: GOD, high above, sees far below; no matter the distance, he knows everything about us.</verse>
<verse>When I walk into the thick of trouble, keep me alive in the angry turmoil. With one hand strike my foes, With your other hand save me.</verse>
<verse>Finish what you started in me, GOD. Your love is eternal--don't quit on me now.</verse>
