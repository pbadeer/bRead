<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="64">
<verse>Listen and help, O God. I'm reduced to a whine And a whimper, obsessed with feelings of doomsday.</verse>
<verse>Don't let them find me--the conspirators out to get me,</verse>
<verse>Using their tongues as weapons, flinging poison words, poison-tipped arrow-words.</verse>
<verse>They shoot from ambush, shoot without warning, not caring who they hit.</verse>
<verse>They keep fit doing calisthenics of evil purpose, They keep lists of the traps they've secretly set. They say to each other, "No one can catch us,</verse>
<verse>no one can detect our perfect crime." The Detective detects the mystery in the dark of the cellar heart.</verse>
<verse>The God of the Arrow shoots! They double up in pain,</verse>
<verse>Fall flat on their faces in full view of the grinning crowd.</verse>
<verse>Everyone sees it. God's work is the talk of the town.</verse>
<verse>Be glad, good people! Fly to GOD! Good-hearted people, make praise your habit.</verse>
