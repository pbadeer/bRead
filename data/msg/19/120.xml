<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="120">
<verse>I'm in trouble. I cry to GOD, desperate for an answer:</verse>
<verse>"Deliver me from the liars, GOD! They smile so sweetly but lie through their teeth."</verse>
<verse>Do you know what's next, can you see what's coming, all you barefaced liars?</verse>
<verse>Pointed arrows and burning coals will be your reward.</verse>
<verse>I'm doomed to live in Meshech, cursed with a home in Kedar,</verse>
<verse>My whole life lived camping among quarreling neighbors.</verse>
<verse>I'm all for peace, but the minute I tell them so, they go to war!</verse>
