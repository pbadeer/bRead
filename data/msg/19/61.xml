<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="61">
<verse>God, listen to me shout, bend an ear to my prayer.</verse>
<verse>When I'm far from anywhere, down to my last gasp, I call out, "Guide me up High Rock Mountain!"</verse>
<verse>You've always given me breathing room, a place to get away from it all,</verse>
<verse>A lifetime pass to your safe-house, an open invitation as your guest.</verse>
<verse>You've always taken me seriously, God, made me welcome among those who know and love you.</verse>
<verse>Let the days of the king add up to years and years of good rule.</verse>
<verse>Set his throne in the full light of God; post Steady Love and Good Faith as lookouts,</verse>
<verse>And I'll be the poet who sings your glory--and live what I sing every day.</verse>
