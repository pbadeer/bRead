<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="116">
<verse>I love GOD because he listened to me, listened as I begged for mercy.</verse>
<verse>He listened so intently as I laid out my case before him.</verse>
<verse>Death stared me in the face, hell was hard on my heels. Up against it, I didn't know which way to turn;</verse>
<verse>then I called out to GOD for help: "Please, GOD!" I cried out. "Save my life!"</verse>
<verse>GOD is gracious--it is he who makes things right, our most compassionate God.</verse>
<verse>GOD takes the side of the helpless; when I was at the end of my rope, he saved me.</verse>
<verse>I said to myself, "Relax and rest. GOD has showered you with blessings.</verse>
<verse>Soul, you've been rescued from death; Eye, you've been rescued from tears; And you, Foot, were kept from stumbling."</verse>
<verse>I'm striding in the presence of GOD, alive in the land of the living!</verse>
<verse>I stayed faithful, though bedeviled, and despite a ton of bad luck,</verse>
<verse>Despite giving up on the human race, saying, "They're all liars and cheats."</verse>
<verse>What can I give back to GOD for the blessings he's poured out on me?</verse>
<verse>I'll lift high the cup of salvation--a toast to GOD! I'll pray in the name of GOD;</verse>
<verse>I'll complete what I promised GOD I'd do, and I'll do it together with his people.</verse>
<verse>When they arrive at the gates of death, GOD welcomes those who love him.</verse>
<verse>Oh, GOD, here I am, your servant, your faithful servant: set me free for your service!</verse>
<verse>I'm ready to offer the thanksgiving sacrifice and pray in the name of GOD.</verse>
<verse>I'll complete what I promised GOD I'd do, and I'll do it in company with his people,</verse>
<verse>In the place of worship, in GOD's house, in Jerusalem, GOD's city. Hallelujah! al</verse>
