<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="8">
<verse>GOD, brilliant Lord, yours is a household name.</verse>
<verse>Nursing infants gurgle choruses about you; toddlers shout the songs That drown out enemy talk, and silence atheist babble.</verse>
<verse>I look up at your macro-skies, dark and enormous, your handmade sky-jewelry, Moon and stars mounted in their settings.</verse>
<verse>Then I look at my micro-self and wonder, Why do you bother with us? Why take a second look our way?</verse>
<verse>Yet we've so narrowly missed being gods, bright with Eden's dawn light.</verse>
<verse>You put us in charge of your handcrafted world, repeated to us your Genesis-charge,</verse>
<verse>Made us lords of sheep and cattle, even animals out in the wild,</verse>
<verse>Birds flying and fish swimming, whales singing in the ocean deeps.</verse>
<verse>GOD, brilliant Lord, your name echoes around the world.</verse>
