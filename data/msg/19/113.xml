<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="113">
<verse>Hallelujah! You who serve GOD, praise GOD! Just to speak his name is praise!</verse>
<verse>Just to remember GOD is a blessing--now and tomorrow and always.</verse>
<verse>From east to west, from dawn to dusk, keep lifting all your praises to GOD!</verse>
<verse>GOD is higher than anything and anyone, outshining everything you can see in the skies.</verse>
<verse>Who can compare with GOD, our God, so majestically enthroned,</verse>
<verse>Surveying his magnificent heavens and earth?</verse>
<verse>He picks up the poor from out of the dirt, rescues the wretched who've been thrown out with the trash,</verse>
<verse>Seats them among the honored guests, a place of honor among the brightest and best.</verse>
<verse>He gives childless couples a family, gives them joy as the parents of children. Hallelujah! al</verse>
