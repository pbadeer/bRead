<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="141">
<verse>GOD, come close. Come quickly! Open your ears--it's my voice you're hearing!</verse>
<verse>Treat my prayer as sweet incense rising; my raised hands are my evening prayers.</verse>
<verse>Post a guard at my mouth, GOD, set a watch at the door of my lips.</verse>
<verse>Don't let me so much as dream of evil or thoughtlessly fall into bad company. And these people who only do wrong--don't let them lure me with their sweet talk!</verse>
<verse>May the Just One set me straight, may the Kind One correct me, Don't let sin anoint my head. I'm praying hard against their evil ways!</verse>
<verse>Oh, let their leaders be pushed off a high rock cliff; make them face the music.</verse>
<verse>Like a rock pulverized by a maul, let their bones be scattered at the gates of hell.</verse>
<verse>But GOD, dear Lord, I only have eyes for you. Since I've run for dear life to you, take good care of me.</verse>
<verse>Protect me from their evil scheming, from all their demonic subterfuge.</verse>
<verse>Let the wicked fall flat on their faces, while I walk off without a scratch. A David prayer--when he was in the cave. he</verse>
