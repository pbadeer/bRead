<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="59">
<verse>My God! Rescue me from my enemies, defend me from these mutineers.</verse>
<verse>Rescue me from their dirty tricks, save me from their hit men.</verse>
<verse>Desperadoes have ganged up on me, they're hiding in ambush for me. I did nothing to deserve this, GOD,</verse>
<verse>crossed no one, wronged no one. All the same, they're after me, determined to get me. Wake up and see for yourself!</verse>
<verse>You're GOD, God of angel armies, Israel's God! Get on the job and take care of these pagans, don't be soft on these hard cases.</verse>
<verse>They return when the sun goes down, They howl like coyotes, ringing the city.</verse>
<verse>Then suddenly they're all at the gate, Snarling invective, drawn daggers in their teeth. They think they'll never get caught.</verse>
<verse>But you, GOD, break out laughing; you treat the godless nations like jokes.</verse>
<verse>Strong God, I'm watching you do it, I can always count on you.</verse>
<verse>God in dependable love shows up on time, shows me my enemies in ruin.</verse>
<verse>Don't make quick work of them, GOD, lest my people forget. Bring them down in slow motion, take them apart piece by piece.</verse>
<verse>Let all their mean-mouthed arrogance catch up with them, Catch them out and bring them down -every muttered curse -every barefaced lie.</verse>
<verse>Finish them off in fine style! Finish them off for good! Then all the world will see that God rules well in Jacob, everywhere that God's in charge.</verse>
<verse>They return when the sun goes down, They howl like coyotes, ringing the city.</verse>
<verse>They scavenge for bones, And bite the hand that feeds them.</verse>
<verse>And me? I'm singing your prowess, shouting at cockcrow your largesse, For you've been a safe place for me, a good place to hide.</verse>
<verse>Strong God, I'm watching you do it, I can always count on you--God, my dependable love.</verse>
