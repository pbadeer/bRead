<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="96">
<verse>Sing GOD a brand-new song! Earth and everyone in it, sing!</verse>
<verse>Sing to GOD-worship GOD! Shout the news of his victory from sea to sea,</verse>
<verse>Take the news of his glory to the lost, News of his wonders to one and all!</verse>
<verse>For GOD is great, and worth a thousand Hallelujahs. His terrible beauty makes the gods look cheap;</verse>
<verse>Pagan gods are mere tatters and rags. GOD made the heavens--</verse>
<verse>Royal splendor radiates from him, A powerful beauty sets him apart.</verse>
<verse>Bravo, GOD, Bravo! Everyone join in the great shout: Encore! In awe before the beauty, in awe before the might.</verse>
<verse>Bring gifts and celebrate,</verse>
<verse>Bow before the beauty of GOD, Then to your knees--everyone worship!</verse>
<verse>Get out the message--GOD Rules! He put the world on a firm foundation; He treats everyone fair and square.</verse>
<verse>Let's hear it from Sky, With Earth joining in, And a huge round of applause from Sea.</verse>
<verse>Let Wilderness turn cartwheels, Animals, come dance, Put every tree of the forest in the choir--</verse>
<verse>An extravaganza before GOD as he comes, As he comes to set everything right on earth, Set everything right, treat everyone fair.</verse>
