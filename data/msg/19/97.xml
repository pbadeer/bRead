<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="97">
<verse>GOD rules: there's something to shout over! On the double, mainlands and islands--celebrate!</verse>
<verse>Bright clouds and storm clouds circle 'round him; Right and justice anchor his rule.</verse>
<verse>Fire blazes out before him, Flaming high up the craggy mountains.</verse>
<verse>His lightnings light up the world; Earth, wide-eyed, trembles in fear.</verse>
<verse>The mountains take one look at GOD And melt, melt like wax before earth's Lord.</verse>
<verse>The heavens announce that he'll set everything right, And everyone will see it happen--glorious!</verse>
<verse>All who serve handcrafted gods will be sorry--And they were so proud of their ragamuffin gods! On your knees, all you gods--worship him!</verse>
<verse>And Zion, you listen and take heart! Daughters of Zion, sing your hearts out: GOD has done it all, has set everything right.</verse>
<verse>You, GOD, are High God of the cosmos, Far, far higher than any of the gods.</verse>
<verse>GOD loves all who hate evil, And those who love him he keeps safe, Snatches them from the grip of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Light-seeds are planted in the souls of God's people, Joy-seeds are planted in good heart-soil.</verse>
<verse>So, God's people, shout praise to GOD, Give thanks to our Holy God!</verse>
