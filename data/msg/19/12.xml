<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="12">
<verse>Quick, GOD, I need your helping hand! The last decent person just went down, All the friends I depended on gone.</verse>
<verse>Everyone talks in lie language; Lies slide off their oily lips. They doubletalk with forked tongues.</verse>
<verse>Slice their lips off their faces! Pull The braggart tongues from their mouths!</verse>
<verse>I'm tired of hearing, "We can talk anyone into anything! Our lips manage the world."</verse>
<verse>Into the hovels of the poor, Into the dark streets where the homeless groan, God speaks: "I've had enough; I'm on my way To heal the ache in the heart of the wretched."</verse>
<verse>God's words are pure words, Pure silver words refined seven times In the fires of his word--kiln, Pure on earth as well as in heaven.</verse>
<verse>GOD, keep us safe from their lies, From the wicked who stalk us with lies,</verse>
<verse>From the wicked who collect honors For their wonderful lies.</verse>
