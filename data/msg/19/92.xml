<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="92">
<verse>What a beautiful thing, GOD, to give thanks, to sing an anthem to you, the High God!</verse>
<verse>To announce your love each daybreak, sing your faithful presence all through the night,</verse>
<verse>Accompanied by dulcimer and harp, the full-bodied music of strings.</verse>
<verse>You made me so happy, GOD. I saw your work and I shouted for joy.</verse>
<verse>How magnificent your work, GOD! How profound your thoughts!</verse>
<verse>Dullards never notice what you do; fools never do get it.</verse>
<verse>When the wicked popped up like weeds and all the evil men and women took over, You mowed them down, finished them off once and for all.</verse>
<verse>You, GOD, are High and Eternal.</verse>
<verse>Look at your enemies, GOD! Look at your enemies--ruined! Scattered to the winds, all those hirelings of evil!</verse>
<verse>But you've made me strong as a charging bison, you've honored me with a festive parade.</verse>
<verse>The sight of my critics going down is still fresh, the rout of my malicious detractors. My ears are filled with the sounds of promise:</verse>
<verse>"Good people will prosper like palm trees, Grow tall like Lebanon cedars;</verse>
<verse>transplanted to GOD's courtyard, They'll grow tall in the presence of God,</verse>
<verse>lithe and green, virile still in old age."</verse>
<verse>Such witnesses to upright GOD! My Mountain, my huge, holy Mountain!</verse>
