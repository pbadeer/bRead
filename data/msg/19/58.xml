<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="58">
<verse>Is this any way to run a country? Is there an honest politician in the house?</verse>
<verse>Behind the scenes you brew cauldrons of evil, behind closed doors you make deals with demons.</verse>
<verse>The wicked crawl from the wrong side of the cradle; their first words out of the womb are lies.</verse>
<verse>Poison, lethal rattlesnake poison, drips from their forked tongues--</verse>
<verse>Deaf to threats, deaf to charm, decades of wax built up in their ears.</verse>
<verse>God, smash their teeth to bits, leave them toothless tigers.</verse>
<verse>Let their lives be buckets of water spilled, all that's left, a damp stain in the sand. Let them be trampled grass worn smooth by the traffic.</verse>
<verse>Let them dissolve into snail slime, be a miscarried fetus that never sees sunlight.</verse>
<verse>Before what they cook up is half-done, God, throw it out with the garbage!</verse>
<verse>The righteous will call up their friends when they see the wicked get their reward, Serve up their blood in goblets as they toast one another,</verse>
<verse>Everyone cheering, "It's worth it to play by the rules! God's handing out trophies and tending the earth!"</verse>
