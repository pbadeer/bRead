<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="18">
<verse>I love you, GOD- you make me strong.</verse>
<verse>GOD is bedrock under my feet, the castle in which I live, my rescuing knight. My God--the high crag where I run for dear life, hiding behind the boulders, safe in the granite hideout.</verse>
<verse>I sing to GOD, the Praise-Lofty, and find myself safe and saved.</verse>
<verse>The hangman's noose was tight at my throat; devil waters rushed over me.</verse>
<verse>Hell's ropes cinched me tight; death traps barred every exit.</verse>
<verse>A hostile world! I call to GOD, I cry to God to help me. From his palace he hears my call; my cry brings me right into his presence--a private audience!</verse>
<verse>Earth wobbles and lurches; huge mountains shake like leaves, Quake like aspen leaves because of his rage.</verse>
<verse>His nostrils flare, bellowing smoke; his mouth spits fire. Tongues of fire dart in and out;</verse>
<verse>he lowers the sky. He steps down; under his feet an abyss opens up.</verse>
<verse>He's riding a winged creature, swift on wind--wings.</verse>
<verse>Now he's wrapped himself in a trenchcoat of black-cloud darkness.</verse>
<verse>But his cloud-brightness bursts through, spraying hailstones and fireballs.</verse>
<verse>Then GOD thundered out of heaven; the High God gave a great shout, spraying hailstones and fireballs.</verse>
<verse>God shoots his arrows--pandemonium! He hurls his lightnings--a rout!</verse>
<verse>The secret sources of ocean are exposed, the hidden depths of earth lie uncovered The moment you roar in protest, let loose your hurricane anger.</verse>
<verse>But me he caught--reached all the way from sky to sea; he pulled me out Of that ocean of hate,</verse>
<verse>that enemy chaos, the void in which I was drowning.</verse>
<verse>They hit me when I was down, but GOD stuck by me.</verse>
<verse>He stood me up on a wide-open field; I stood there saved--surprised to be loved!</verse>
<verse>GOD made my life complete when I placed all the pieces before him. When I got my act together, he gave me a fresh start.</verse>
<verse>Now I'm alert to GOD's ways; I don't take God for granted.</verse>
<verse>Every day I review the ways he works; I try not to miss a trick.</verse>
<verse>I feel put back together, and I'm watching my step.</verse>
<verse>GOD rewrote the text of my life when I opened the book of my heart to his eyes.</verse>
<verse>The good people taste your goodness, The whole people taste your health,</verse>
<verse>The true people taste your truth, The bad ones can't figure you out.</verse>
<verse>You take the side of the down--and-out, But the stuck-up you take down a peg.</verse>
<verse>Suddenly, GOD, you floodlight my life; I'm blazing with glory, God's glory!</verse>
<verse>I smash the bands of marauders, I vault the highest fences.</verse>
<verse>What a God! His road stretches straight and smooth. Every GOD-direction is road-tested. Everyone who runs toward him Makes it.</verse>
<verse>Is there any god like GOD? Are we not at bedrock?</verse>
<verse>Is not this the God who armed me, then aimed me in the right direction?</verse>
<verse>Now I run like a deer; I'm king of the mountain.</verse>
<verse>He shows me how to fight; I can bend a bronze bow!</verse>
<verse>You protect me with salvation--armor; you hold me up with a firm hand, caress me with your gentle ways.</verse>
<verse>You cleared the ground under me so my footing was firm.</verse>
<verse>When I chased my enemies I caught them; I didn't let go till they were dead men.</verse>
<verse>I nailed them; they were down for good; then I walked all over them.</verse>
<verse>You armed me well for this fight, you smashed the upstarts.</verse>
<verse>You made my enemies turn tail, and I wiped out the haters.</verse>
<verse>They cried "uncle" but Uncle didn't come; They yelled for GOD and got no for an answer.</verse>
<verse>I ground them to dust; they gusted in the wind. I threw them out, like garbage in the gutter.</verse>
<verse>You rescued me from a squabbling people; you made me a leader of nations. People I'd never heard of served me;</verse>
<verse>the moment they got wind of me they listened. The foreign devils gave up;</verse>
<verse>they came on their bellies, crawling from their hideouts.</verse>
<verse>Live, GOD! Blessings from my Rock, my free and freeing God, towering!</verse>
<verse>This God set things right for me and shut up the people who talked back.</verse>
<verse>He rescued me from enemy anger, he pulled me from the grip of upstarts, He saved me from the bullies.</verse>
<verse>That's why I'm thanking you, GOD, all over the world. That's why I'm singing songs that rhyme your name.</verse>
<verse>God's king takes the trophy; God's chosen is beloved. I mean David and all his children--always.</verse>
