<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="146">
<verse>Hallelujah! O my soul, praise GOD!</verse>
<verse>All my life long I'll praise GOD, singing songs to my God as long as I live.</verse>
<verse>Don't put your life in the hands of experts who know nothing of life, of salvation life.</verse>
<verse>Mere humans don't have what it takes; when they die, their projects die with them.</verse>
<verse>Instead, get help from the God of Jacob, put your hope in GOD and know real blessing!</verse>
<verse>GOD made sky and soil, sea and all the fish in it. He always does what he says--</verse>
<verse>he defends the wronged, he feeds the hungry. GOD frees prisoners--</verse>
<verse>he gives sight to the blind, he lifts up the fallen. GOD loves good people,</verse>
<verse>protects strangers, takes the side of orphans and widows, but makes short work of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>GOD's in charge--always. Zion's God is God for good! Hallelujah! al</verse>
