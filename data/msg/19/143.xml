<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="143">
<verse>Listen to this prayer of mine, GOD; pay attention to what I'm asking. Answer me--you're famous for your answers! Do what's right for me.</verse>
<verse>But don't, please don't, haul me into court; not a person alive would be acquitted there.</verse>
<verse>The enemy hunted me down; he kicked me and stomped me within an inch of my life. He put me in a black hole, buried me like a corpse in that dungeon.</verse>
<verse>I sat there in despair, my spirit draining away, my heart heavy, like lead.</verse>
<verse>I remembered the old days, went over all you've done, pondered the ways you've worked,</verse>
<verse>Stretched out my hands to you, as thirsty for you as a desert thirsty for rain.</verse>
<verse>Hurry with your answer, GOD! I'm nearly at the end of my rope. Don't turn away; don't ignore me! That would be certain death.</verse>
<verse>If you wake me each morning with the sound of your loving voice, I'll go to sleep each night trusting in you. Point out the road I must travel; I'm all ears, all eyes before you.</verse>
<verse>Save me from my enemies, GOD- you're my only hope!</verse>
<verse>Teach me how to live to please you, because you're my God. Lead me by your blessed Spirit into cleared and level pastureland.</verse>
<verse>Keep up your reputation, God--give me life! In your justice, get me out of this trouble!</verse>
<verse>In your great love, vanquish my enemies; make a clean sweep of those who harass me. And why? Because I'm your servant.</verse>
