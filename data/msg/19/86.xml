<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="86">
<verse>Bend an ear, GOD; answer me. I'm one miserable wretch!</verse>
<verse>Keep me safe--haven't I lived a good life? Help your servant--I'm depending on you!</verse>
<verse>You're my God; have mercy on me. I count on you from morning to night.</verse>
<verse>Give your servant a happy life; I put myself in your hands!</verse>
<verse>You're well-known as good and forgiving, bighearted to all who ask for help.</verse>
<verse>Pay attention, GOD, to my prayer; bend down and listen to my cry for help.</verse>
<verse>Every time I'm in trouble I call on you, confident that you'll answer.</verse>
<verse>There's no one quite like you among the gods, O Lord, and nothing to compare with your works.</verse>
<verse>All the nations you made are on their way, ready to give honor to you, O Lord, Ready to put your beauty on display,</verse>
<verse>parading your greatness, And the great things you do--God, you're the one, there's no one but you!</verse>
<verse>Train me, GOD, to walk straight; then I'll follow your true path. Put me together, one heart and mind; then, undivided, I'll worship in joyful fear.</verse>
<verse>From the bottom of my heart I thank you, dear Lord; I've never kept secret what you're up to.</verse>
<verse>You've always been great toward me--what love! You snatched me from the brink of disaster!</verse>
<verse>God, these bullies have reared their heads! A gang of thugs is after me--and they don't care a thing about you.</verse>
<verse>But you, O God, are both tender and kind, not easily angered, immense in love, and you never, never quit.</verse>
<verse>So look me in the eye and show kindness, give your servant the strength to go on, save your dear, dear child!</verse>
<verse>Make a show of how much you love me so the bullies who hate me will stand there slack-jawed, As you, GOD, gently and powerfully put me back on my feet. A Korah psalm</verse>
