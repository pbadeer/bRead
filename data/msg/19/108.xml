<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="108">
<verse>I'm ready, God, so ready, ready from head to toe. Ready to sing, ready to raise a God--song:</verse>
<verse>"Wake, soul! Wake, lute! Wake up, you sleepyhead sun!"</verse>
<verse>I'm thanking you, GOD, out in the streets, singing your praises in town and country.</verse>
<verse>The deeper your love, the higher it goes; every cloud's a flag to your faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!</verse>
<verse>And for the sake of the one you love so much, reach down and help me--answer me!</verse>
<verse>That's when God spoke in holy splendor: "Brimming over with joy, I make a present of Shechem, I hand out Succoth Valley as a gift.</verse>
<verse>Gilead's in my pocket, to say nothing of Manasseh. Ephraim's my hard hat, Judah my hammer.</verse>
<verse>Moab's a scrub bucket--I mop the floor with Moab, Spit on Edom, rain fireworks all over Philistia."</verse>
<verse>Who will take me to the thick of the fight? Who'll show me the road to Edom?</verse>
<verse>You aren't giving up on us, are you, God? refusing to go out with our troops?</verse>
<verse>Give us help for the hard task; human help is worthless.</verse>
<verse>In God we'll do our very best; he'll flatten the opposition for good. A David prayer</verse>
