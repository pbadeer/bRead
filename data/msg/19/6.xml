<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="6">
<verse>Please, GOD, no more yelling, no more trips to the woodshed.</verse>
<verse>Treat me nice for a change; I'm so starved for affection. Can't you see I'm black and blue, beat up badly in bones</verse>
<verse>and soul? GOD, how long will it take for you to let up?</verse>
<verse>Break in, GOD, and break up this fight; if you love me at all, get me out of here.</verse>
<verse>I'm no good to you dead, am I? I can't sing in your choir if I'm buried in some tomb!</verse>
<verse>I'm tired of all this--so tired. My bed has been floating forty days and nights On the flood of my tears. My mattress is soaked, soggy with tears.</verse>
<verse>The sockets of my eyes are black holes; nearly blind, I squint and grope.</verse>
<verse>Get out of here, you Devil's crew: at last GOD has heard my sobs.</verse>
<verse>My requests have all been granted, my prayers are answered.</verse>
<verse>Cowards, my enemies disappear. Disgraced, they turn tail and run.</verse>
