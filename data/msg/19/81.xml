<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="81">
<verse>A song to our strong God! a shout to the God of Jacob!</verse>
<verse>Anthems from the choir, music from the band, sweet sounds from lute and harp,</verse>
<verse>Trumpets and trombones and horns: it's festival day, a feast to God!</verse>
<verse>A day decreed by God, solemnly ordered by the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>He commanded Joseph to keep this day so we'd never forget what he did in Egypt. I hear this most gentle whisper from One I never guessed would speak to me:</verse>
<verse>"I took the world off your shoulders, freed you from a life of hard labor.</verse>
<verse>You called to me in your pain; I got you out of a bad place. I answered you from where the thunder hides, I proved you at Meribah Fountain.</verse>
<verse>"Listen, dear ones--get this straight; O Israel, don't take this lightly.</verse>
<verse>Don't take up with strange gods, don't worship the latest in gods.</verse>
<verse>I'm GOD, your God, the very God who rescued you from doom in Egypt, Then fed you all you could eat, filled your hungry stomachs.</verse>
<verse>"But my people didn't listen, Israel paid no attention;</verse>
<verse>So I let go of the reins and told them, "Run! Do it your own way!'</verse>
<verse>"Oh, dear people, will you listen to me now? Israel, will you follow my map?</verse>
<verse>I'll make short work of your enemies, give your foes the back of my hand.</verse>
<verse>I'll send the GOD-haters cringing like dogs, never to be heard from again.</verse>
<verse>You'll feast on my fresh-baked bread spread with butter and rock-pure honey." An Asaph psalm</verse>
