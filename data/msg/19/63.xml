<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="63">
<verse>God--you're my God! I can't get enough of you! I've worked up such hunger and thirst for God, traveling across dry and weary deserts.</verse>
<verse>So here I am in the place of worship, eyes open, drinking in your strength and glory.</verse>
<verse>In your generous love I am really living at last! My lips brim praises like fountains.</verse>
<verse>I bless you every time I take a breath; My arms wave like banners of praise to you.</verse>
<verse>I eat my fill of prime rib and gravy; I smack my lips. It's time to shout praises!</verse>
<verse>If I'm sleepless at midnight, I spend the hours in grateful reflection.</verse>
<verse>Because you've always stood up for me, I'm free to run and play.</verse>
<verse>I hold on to you for dear life, and you hold me steady as a post.</verse>
<verse>Those who are out to get me are marked for doom, marked for death, bound for hell.</verse>
<verse>They'll die violent deaths; jackals will tear them limb from limb.</verse>
<verse>But the king is glad in God; his true friends spread the joy, While small-minded gossips are gagged for good.</verse>
