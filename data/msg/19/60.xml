<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="60">
<verse>God! you walked off and left us, kicked our defenses to bits And stalked off angry. Come back. Oh please, come back!</verse>
<verse>You shook earth to the foundations, ripped open huge crevasses. Heal the breaks! Everything's coming apart at the seams.</verse>
<verse>You made your people look doom in the face, then gave us cheap wine to drown our troubles.</verse>
<verse>Then you planted a flag to rally your people, an unfurled flag to look to for courage.</verse>
<verse>Now do something quickly, answer right now, so the one you love best is saved.</verse>
<verse>That's when God spoke in holy splendor, "Bursting with joy, I make a present of Shechem, I hand out Succoth Valley as a gift.</verse>
<verse>Gilead's in my pocket, to say nothing of Manasseh. Ephraim's my hard hat, Judah my hammer;</verse>
<verse>Moab's a scrub bucket, I mop the floor with Moab, Spit on Edom, rain fireworks all over Philistia."</verse>
<verse>Who will take me to the thick of the fight? Who'll show me the road to Edom?</verse>
<verse>You aren't giving up on us, are you, God? refusing to go out with our troops?</verse>
<verse>Give us help for the hard task; human help is worthless.</verse>
<verse>In God we'll do our very best; he'll flatten the opposition for good.</verse>
