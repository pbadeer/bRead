<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="137">
<verse>Alongside Babylon's rivers we sat on the banks; we cried and cried, remembering the good old days in Zion.</verse>
<verse>Alongside the quaking aspens we stacked our unplayed harps;</verse>
<verse>That's where our captors demanded songs, sarcastic and mocking: "Sing us a happy Zion song!"</verse>
<verse>Oh, how could we ever sing GOD's song in this wasteland?</verse>
<verse>If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, let my fingers wither and fall off like leaves.</verse>
<verse>Let my tongue swell and turn black if I fail to remember you, If I fail, O dear Jerusalem, to honor you as my greatest.</verse>
<verse>GOD, remember those Edomites, and remember the ruin of Jerusalem, That day they yelled out, "Wreck it, smash it to bits!"</verse>
<verse>And you, Babylonians--ravagers! A reward to whoever gets back at you for all you've done to us;</verse>
<verse>Yes, a reward to the one who grabs your babies and smashes their heads on the rocks!</verse>
