<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="1">
<verse>How well God must like you--you don't hang out at Sin Saloon, you don't slink along Dead-End Road, you don't go to Smart-Mouth College.</verse>
<verse>Instead you thrill to GOD's Word, you chew on Scripture day and night.</verse>
<verse>You're a tree replanted in Eden, bearing fresh fruit every month, Never dropping a leaf, always in blossom.</verse>
<verse>You're not at all like the wicked, who are mere windblown dust--</verse>
<verse>Without defense in court, unfit company for innocent people.</verse>
<verse>GOD charts the road you take. The road they take is Skid Row.</verse>
