<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="5">
<verse>Listen, GOD! Please, pay attention! Can you make sense of these ramblings,</verse>
<verse>my groans and cries? King-God, I need your help.</verse>
<verse>Every morning you'll hear me at it again. Every morning I lay out the pieces of my life on your altar and watch for fire to descend.</verse>
<verse>You don't socialize with Wicked, or invite Evil over as your houseguest.</verse>
<verse>Hot-Air-Boaster collapses in front of you; you shake your head over Mischief-Maker.</verse>
<verse>GOD destroys Lie-Speaker; Blood-Thirsty and Truth-Bender disgust you.</verse>
<verse>And here I am, your invited guest--it's incredible! I enter your house; here I am, prostrate in your inner sanctum,</verse>
<verse>Waiting for directions to get me safely through enemy lines.</verse>
<verse>Every word they speak is a land mine; their lungs breathe out poison gas. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides.</verse>
<verse>Pile on the guilt, God! Let their so-called wisdom wreck them. Kick them out! They've had their chance.</verse>
<verse>But you'll welcome us with open arms when we run for cover to you. Let the party last all night! Stand guard over our celebration.</verse>
<verse>You are famous, GOD, for welcoming God--seekers, for decking us out in delight.</verse>
