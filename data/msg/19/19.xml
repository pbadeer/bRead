<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="19">
<verse>God's glory is on tour in the skies, God--craft on exhibit across the horizon.</verse>
<verse>Madame Day holds classes every morning, Professor Night lectures each evening.</verse>
<verse>Their words aren't heard, their voices aren't recorded,</verse>
<verse>But their silence fills the earth: unspoken truth is spoken everywhere. God makes a huge dome for the sun--a superdome!</verse>
<verse>The morning sun's a new husband leaping from his honeymoon bed, The daybreaking sun an athlete racing to the tape.</verse>
<verse>That's how God's Word vaults across the skies from sunrise to sunset, Melting ice, scorching deserts, warming hearts to faith.</verse>
<verse>The revelation of GOD is whole and pulls our lives together. The signposts of GOD are clear and point out the right road.</verse>
<verse>The life--maps of GOD are right, showing the way to joy. The directions of GOD are plain and easy on the eyes.</verse>
<verse>GOD's reputation is twenty-four-carat gold, with a lifetime guarantee. The decisions of GOD are accurate down to the nth degree.</verse>
<verse>God's Word is better than a diamond, better than a diamond set between emeralds. You'll like it better than strawberries in spring, better than red, ripe strawberries.</verse>
<verse>There's more: God's Word warns us of danger and directs us to hidden treasure.</verse>
<verse>Otherwise how will we find our way? Or know when we play the fool?</verse>
<verse>Clean the slate, God, so we can start the day fresh! Keep me from stupid sins, from thinking I can take over your work; Then I can start this day sun-washed, scrubbed clean of the grime of sin.</verse>
<verse>These are the words in my mouth; these are what I chew on and pray. Accept them when I place them on the morning altar, O God, my Altar-Rock, God, Priest-of-My-Altar.</verse>
