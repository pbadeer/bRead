<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="85">
<verse>GOD, you smiled on your good earth! You brought good times back to Jacob!</verse>
<verse>You lifted the cloud of guilt from your people, you put their sins far out of sight.</verse>
<verse>You took back your sin-provoked threats, you cooled your hot, righteous anger.</verse>
<verse>Help us again, God of our help; don't hold a grudge against us forever.</verse>
<verse>You aren't going to keep this up, are you? scowling and angry, year after year?</verse>
<verse>Why not help us make a fresh start--a resurrection life? Then your people will laugh and sing!</verse>
<verse>Show us how much you love us, GOD! Give us the salvation we need!</verse>
<verse>I can't wait to hear what he'll say. GOD's about to pronounce his people well, The holy people he loves so much, so they'll never again live like fools.</verse>
<verse>See how close his salvation is to those who fear him? Our country is home base for Glory!</verse>
<verse>Love and Truth meet in the street, Right Living and Whole Living embrace and kiss!</verse>
<verse>Truth sprouts green from the ground, Right Living pours down from the skies!</verse>
<verse>Oh yes! GOD gives Goodness and Beauty; our land responds with Bounty and Blessing.</verse>
<verse>Right Living strides out before him, and clears a path for his passage.</verse>
