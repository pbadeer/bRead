<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="133">
<verse>How wonderful, how beautiful, when brothers and sisters get along!</verse>
<verse>It's like costly anointing oil flowing down head and beard, Flowing down Aaron's beard, flowing down the collar of his priestly robes.</verse>
<verse>It's like the dew on Mount Hermon flowing down the slopes of Zion. Yes, that's where GOD commands the blessing, ordains eternal life.</verse>
