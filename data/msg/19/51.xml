<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="51">
<verse>Generous in love--God, give grace! Huge in mercy--wipe out my bad record.</verse>
<verse>Scrub away my guilt, soak out my sins in your laundry.</verse>
<verse>I know how bad I've been; my sins are staring me down.</verse>
<verse>You're the One I've violated, and you've seen it all, seen the full extent of my evil. You have all the facts before you; whatever you decide about me is fair.</verse>
<verse>I've been out of step with you for a long time, in the wrong since before I was born.</verse>
<verse>What you're after is truth from the inside out. Enter me, then; conceive a new, true life.</verse>
<verse>Soak me in your laundry and I'll come out clean, scrub me and I'll have a snow-white life.</verse>
<verse>Tune me in to foot-tapping songs, set these once-broken bones to dancing.</verse>
<verse>Don't look too close for blemishes, give me a clean bill of health.</verse>
<verse>God, make a fresh start in me, shape a Genesis week from the chaos of my life.</verse>
<verse>Don't throw me out with the trash, or fail to breathe holiness in me.</verse>
<verse>Bring me back from gray exile, put a fresh wind in my sails!</verse>
<verse>Give me a job teaching rebels your ways so the lost can find their way home.</verse>
<verse>Commute my death sentence, God, my salvation God, and I'll sing anthems to your life--giving ways.</verse>
<verse>Unbutton my lips, dear God; I'll let loose with your praise.</verse>
<verse>Going through the motions doesn't please you, a flawless performance is nothing to you.</verse>
<verse>I learned God--worship when my pride was shattered. Heart-shattered lives ready for love don't for a moment escape God's notice.</verse>
<verse>Make Zion the place you delight in, repair Jerusalem's broken-down walls.</verse>
<verse>Then you'll get real worship from us, acts of worship small and large, Including all the bulls they can heave onto your altar!</verse>
