<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="36">
<verse>The God--rebel tunes in to sedition--all ears, eager to sin. He has no regard for God, he stands insolent before him.</verse>
<verse>He has smooth-talked himself into believing That his evil will never be noticed.</verse>
<verse>Words gutter from his mouth, dishwater dirty. Can't remember when he did anything decent.</verse>
<verse>Every time he goes to bed, he fathers another evil plot. When he's loose on the streets, nobody's safe. He plays with fire and doesn't care who gets burned.</verse>
<verse>God's love is meteoric, his loyalty astronomic,</verse>
<verse>His purpose titanic, his verdicts oceanic. Yet in his largeness nothing gets lost; Not a man, not a mouse, slips through the cracks.</verse>
<verse>How exquisite your love, O God! How eager we are to run under your wings,</verse>
<verse>To eat our fill at the banquet you spread as you fill our tankards with Eden spring water.</verse>
<verse>You're a fountain of cascading light, and you open our eyes to light.</verse>
<verse>Keep on loving your friends; do your work in welcoming hearts.</verse>
<verse>Don't let the bullies kick me around, the moral midgets slap me down.</verse>
<verse>Send the upstarts sprawling flat on their faces in the mud.</verse>
