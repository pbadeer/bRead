<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="30">
<verse>I give you all the credit, GOD- you got me out of that mess, you didn't let my foes gloat.</verse>
<verse>GOD, my God, I yelled for help and you put me together.</verse>
<verse>GOD, you pulled me out of the grave, gave me another chance at life when I was down--and-out.</verse>
<verse>All you saints! Sing your hearts out to GOD! Thank him to his face!</verse>
<verse>He gets angry once in a while, but across a lifetime there is only love. The nights of crying your eyes out give way to days of laughter.</verse>
<verse>When things were going great I crowed, "I've got it made.</verse>
<verse>I'm GOD's favorite. He made me king of the mountain." Then you looked the other way and I fell to pieces.</verse>
<verse>I called out to you, GOD; I laid my case before you:</verse>
<verse>"Can you sell me for a profit when I'm dead? auction me off at a cemetery yard sale? When I'm "dust to dust' my songs and stories of you won't sell.</verse>
<verse>So listen! and be kind! Help me out of this!"</verse>
<verse>You did it: you changed wild lament into whirling dance; You ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers.</verse>
<verse>I'm about to burst with song; I can't keep quiet about you. GOD, my God, I can't thank you enough.</verse>
