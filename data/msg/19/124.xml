<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="124">
<verse>If GOD hadn't been for us -all together now, Israel, sing out!-</verse>
<verse>If GOD hadn't been for us when everyone went against us,</verse>
<verse>We would have been swallowed alive by their violent anger,</verse>
<verse>Swept away by the flood of rage, drowned in the torrent;</verse>
<verse>We would have lost our lives in the wild, raging water.</verse>
<verse>Oh, blessed be GOD! He didn't go off and leave us. He didn't abandon us defenseless, helpless as a rabbit in a pack of snarling dogs.</verse>
<verse>We've flown free from their fangs, free of their traps, free as a bird. Their grip is broken; we're free as a bird in flight.</verse>
<verse>GOD's strong name is our help, the same GOD who made heaven and earth.</verse>
