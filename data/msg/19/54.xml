<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="54">
<verse>God, for your sake, help me! Use your influence to clear me.</verse>
<verse>Listen, God--I'm desperate. Don't be too busy to hear me.</verse>
<verse>Outlaws are out to get me, hit men are trying to kill me. Nothing will stop them; God means nothing to them.</verse>
<verse>Oh, look! God's right here helping! GOD's on my side,</verse>
<verse>Evil is looping back on my enemies. Don't let up! Finish them off!</verse>
<verse>I'm ready now to worship, so ready. I thank you, GOD-you're so good.</verse>
<verse>You got me out of every scrape, and I saw my enemies get it.</verse>
