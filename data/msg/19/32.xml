<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="32">
<verse>Count yourself lucky, how happy you must be--you get a fresh start, your slate's wiped clean.</verse>
<verse>Count yourself lucky--GOD holds nothing against you and you're holding nothing back from him.</verse>
<verse>When I kept it all inside, my bones turned to powder, my words became daylong groans.</verse>
<verse>The pressure never let up; all the juices of my life dried up.</verse>
<verse>Then I let it all out; I said, "I'll make a clean breast of my failures to GOD." Suddenly the pressure was gone--my guilt dissolved, my sin disappeared.</verse>
<verse>These things add up. Every one of us needs to pray; when all hell breaks loose and the dam bursts we'll be on high ground, untouched.</verse>
<verse>GOD's my island hideaway, keeps danger far from the shore, throws garlands of hosannas around my neck.</verse>
<verse>Let me give you some good advice; I'm looking you in the eye and giving it to you straight:</verse>
<verse>"Don't be ornery like a horse or mule that needs bit and bridle to stay on track."</verse>
<verse>God--defiers are always in trouble; GOD-affirmers find themselves loved every time they turn around.</verse>
<verse>Celebrate GOD. Sing together--everyone! All you honest hearts, raise the roof!</verse>
