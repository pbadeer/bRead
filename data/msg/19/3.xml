<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="3">
<verse>GOD! Look! Enemies past counting! Enemies sprouting like mushrooms,</verse>
<verse>Mobs of them all around me, roaring their mockery: "Hah! No help for him from God!"</verse>
<verse>But you, GOD, shield me on all sides; You ground my feet, you lift my head high;</verse>
<verse>With all my might I shout up to GOD, His answers thunder from the holy mountain.</verse>
<verse>I stretch myself out. I sleep. Then I'm up again--rested, tall and steady,</verse>
<verse>Fearless before the enemy mobs Coming at me from all sides.</verse>
<verse>Up, GOD! My God, help me! Slap their faces, First this cheek, then the other, Your fist hard in their teeth!</verse>
<verse>Real help comes from GOD. Your blessing clothes your people!</verse>
