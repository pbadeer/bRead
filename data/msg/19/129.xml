<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="129">
<verse>"They've kicked me around ever since I was young"--this is how Israel tells it--</verse>
<verse>"They've kicked me around ever since I was young, but they never could keep me down.</verse>
<verse>Their plowmen plowed long furrows up and down my back;</verse>
<verse>Then GOD ripped the harnesses of the evil plowmen to shreds."</verse>
<verse>Oh, let all those who hate Zion grovel in humiliation;</verse>
<verse>Let them be like grass in shallow ground that withers before the harvest,</verse>
<verse>Before the farmhands can gather it in, the harvesters get in the crop,</verse>
<verse>Before the neighbors have a chance to call out, "Congratulations on your wonderful crop! We bless you in GOD's name!"</verse>
