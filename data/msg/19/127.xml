<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="127">
<verse>If GOD doesn't build the house, the builders only build shacks. If GOD doesn't guard the city, the night watchman might as well nap.</verse>
<verse>It's useless to rise early and go to bed late, and work your worried fingers to the bone. Don't you know he enjoys giving rest to those he loves?</verse>
<verse>Don't you see that children are GOD's best gift? the fruit of the womb his generous legacy?</verse>
<verse>Like a warrior's fistful of arrows are the children of a vigorous youth.</verse>
<verse>Oh, how blessed are you parents, with your quivers full of children! Your enemies don't stand a chance against you; you'll sweep them right off your doorstep.</verse>
