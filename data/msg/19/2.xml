<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="2">
<verse>Why the big noise, nations? Why the mean plots, peoples?</verse>
<verse>Earth-leaders push for position, Demagogues and delegates meet for summit talks, The God--deniers, the Messiah-defiers:</verse>
<verse>"Let's get free of God! Cast loose from Messiah!"</verse>
<verse>Heaven-throned God breaks out laughing. At first he's amused at their presumption;</verse>
<verse>Then he gets good and angry. Furiously, he shuts them up:</verse>
<verse>"Don't you know there's a King in Zion? A coronation banquet Is spread for him on the holy summit."</verse>
<verse>Let me tell you what GOD said next. He said, "You're my son, And today is your birthday.</verse>
<verse>What do you want? Name it: Nations as a present? continents as a prize?</verse>
<verse>You can command them all to dance for you, Or throw them out with tomorrow's trash."</verse>
<verse>So, rebel-kings, use your heads; Upstart-judges, learn your lesson:</verse>
<verse>Worship GOD in adoring embrace, Celebrate in trembling awe.</verse>
<verse>Kiss Messiah! Your very lives are in danger, you know; His anger is about to explode, But if you make a run for God--you won't regret it!</verse>
