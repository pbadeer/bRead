<verse>The word of GOD to my Lord: "Sit alongside me here on my throne until I make your enemies a stool for your feet."</verse>
<verse>You were forged a strong scepter by GOD of Zion; now rule, though surrounded by enemies!</verse>
<verse>Your people will freely join you, resplendent in holy armor on the great day of your conquest, Join you at the fresh break of day, join you with all the vigor of youth.</verse>
<verse>GOD gave his word and he won't take it back: you're the permanent priest, the Melchizedek priest.</verse>
<verse>The Lord stands true at your side, crushing kings in his terrible wrath,</verse>
<verse>Bringing judgment on the nations, handing out convictions wholesale, crushing opposition across the wide earth.</verse>
<verse>The King-Maker put his King on the throne; the True King rules with head held high! he</verse>
