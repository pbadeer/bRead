<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="52">
<verse>Why do you brag of evil, "Big Man"? God's mercy carries the day.</verse>
<verse>You scheme catastrophe; your tongue cuts razor-sharp, artisan in lies.</verse>
<verse>You love evil more than good, you call black white.</verse>
<verse>You love malicious gossip, you foul-mouth.</verse>
<verse>God will tear you limb from limb, sweep you up and throw you out, Pull you up by the roots from the land of life.</verse>
<verse>Good people will watch and worship. They'll laugh in relief:</verse>
<verse>"Big Man bet on the wrong horse, trusted in big money, made his living from catastrophe."</verse>
<verse>And I'm an olive tree, growing green in God's house. I trusted in the generous mercy of God then and now.</verse>
<verse>I thank you always that you went into action. And I'll stay right here, your good name my hope, in company with your faithful friends.</verse>
