<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="26">
<verse>Clear my name, GOD; I've kept an honest shop. I've thrown in my lot with you, GOD, and I'm not budging.</verse>
<verse>Examine me, GOD, from head to foot, order your battery of tests. Make sure I'm fit inside and out</verse>
<verse>So I never lose sight of your love, But keep in step with you, never missing a beat.</verse>
<verse>I don't hang out with tricksters, I don't pal around with thugs;</verse>
<verse>I hate that pack of gangsters, I don't deal with double-dealers.</verse>
<verse>I scrub my hands with purest soap, then join hands with the others in the great circle, dancing around your altar, GOD,</verse>
<verse>Singing God--songs at the top of my lungs, telling God--stories.</verse>
<verse>GOD, I love living with you; your house glows with your glory.</verse>
<verse>When it's time for spring cleaning, don't sweep me out with the quacks and crooks,</verse>
<verse>Men with bags of dirty tricks, women with purses stuffed with bribe--money.</verse>
<verse>You know I've been aboveboard with you; now be aboveboard with me.</verse>
<verse>I'm on the level with you, GOD; I bless you every chance I get.</verse>
