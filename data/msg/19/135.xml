<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="135">
<verse>Hallelujah! Praise the name of GOD, praise the works of GOD.</verse>
<verse>All you priests on duty in GOD's temple, serving in the sacred halls of our God,</verse>
<verse>Shout "Hallelujah!" because GOD's so good, sing anthems to his beautiful name.</verse>
<verse>And why? Because GOD chose Jacob, embraced Israel as a prize possession.</verse>
<verse>I too give witness to the greatness of GOD, our Lord, high above all other gods.</verse>
<verse>He does just as he pleases--however, wherever, whenever.</verse>
<verse>He makes the weather--clouds and thunder, lightning and rain, wind pouring out of the north.</verse>
<verse>He struck down the Egyptian firstborn, both human and animal firstborn.</verse>
<verse>He made Egypt sit up and take notice, confronted Pharaoh and his servants with miracles.</verse>
<verse>Yes, he struck down great nations, he slew mighty kings--</verse>
<verse>Sihon king of the Amorites, also Og of Bashan--every last one of the Canaanite kings!</verse>
<verse>Then he turned their land over to Israel, a gift of good land to his people.</verse>
<verse>GOD, your name is eternal, GOD, you'll never be out--of-date.</verse>
<verse>GOD stands up for his people, GOD holds the hands of his people.</verse>
<verse>The gods of the godless nations are mere trinkets, made for quick sale in the markets:</verse>
<verse>Chiseled mouths that can't talk, painted eyes that can't see,</verse>
<verse>Carved ears that can't hear--dead wood! cold metal!</verse>
<verse>Those who make and trust them become like them.</verse>
<verse>Family of Israel, bless GOD! Family of Aaron, bless GOD!</verse>
<verse>Family of Levi, bless GOD! You who fear GOD, bless GOD!</verse>
<verse>Oh, blessed be GOD of Zion, First Citizen of Jerusalem! Hallelujah! al</verse>
