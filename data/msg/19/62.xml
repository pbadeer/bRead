<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="62">
<verse>God, the one and only--I'll wait as long as he says. Everything I need comes from him, so why not?</verse>
<verse>He's solid rock under my feet, breathing room for my soul, An impregnable castle: I'm set for life.</verse>
<verse>How long will you gang up on me? How long will you run with the bullies? There's nothing to you, any of you--rotten floorboards, worm-eaten rafters,</verse>
<verse>Anthills plotting to bring down mountains, far gone in make-believe. You talk a good line, but every "blessing" breathes a curse.</verse>
<verse>God, the one and only--I'll wait as long as he says. Everything I hope for comes from him, so why not?</verse>
<verse>He's solid rock under my feet, breathing room for my soul, An impregnable castle: I'm set for life.</verse>
<verse>My help and glory are in God -granite-strength and safe-harbor-God--</verse>
<verse>So trust him absolutely, people; lay your lives on the line for him. God is a safe place to be.</verse>
<verse>Man as such is smoke, woman as such, a mirage. Put them together, they're nothing; two times nothing is nothing.</verse>
<verse>And a windfall, if it comes--don't make too much of it.</verse>
<verse>God said this once and for all; how many times Have I heard it repeated? "Strength comes Straight from God."</verse>
<verse>Love to you, Lord God! You pay a fair wage for a good day's work!</verse>
