<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="140">
<verse>GOD, get me out of here, away from this evil; protect me from these vicious people.</verse>
<verse>All they do is think up new ways to be bad; they spend their days plotting war games.</verse>
<verse>They practice the sharp rhetoric of hate and hurt, speak venomous words that maim and kill.</verse>
<verse>GOD, keep me out of the clutch of these wicked ones, protect me from these vicious people;</verse>
<verse>Stuffed with self-importance, they plot ways to trip me up, determined to bring me down. These crooks invent traps to catch me and do their best to incriminate me.</verse>
<verse>I prayed, "GOD, you're my God! Listen, GOD! Mercy!</verse>
<verse>GOD, my Lord, Strong Savior, protect me when the fighting breaks out!</verse>
<verse>Don't let the wicked have their way, GOD, don't give them an inch!"</verse>
<verse>These troublemakers all around me--let them drown in their own verbal poison.</verse>
<verse>Let God pile hellfire on them, let him bury them alive in crevasses!</verse>
<verse>These loudmouths--don't let them be taken seriously; These savages--let the Devil hunt them down!</verse>
<verse>I know that you, GOD, are on the side of victims, that you care for the rights of the poor.</verse>
<verse>And I know that the righteous personally thank you, that good people are secure in your presence.</verse>
