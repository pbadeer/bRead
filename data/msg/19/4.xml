<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="4">
<verse>When I call, give me answers. God, take my side! Once, in a tight place, you gave me room; Now I'm in trouble again: grace me! hear me!</verse>
<verse>You rabble--how long do I put up with your scorn? How long will you lust after lies? How long will you live crazed by illusion?</verse>
<verse>Look at this: look Who got picked by GOD! He listens the split second I call to him.</verse>
<verse>Complain if you must, but don't lash out. Keep your mouth shut, and let your heart do the talking.</verse>
<verse>Build your case before God and wait for his verdict.</verse>
<verse>Why is everyone hungry for more? "More, more," they say. "More, more." I have God's more-than-enough,</verse>
<verse>More joy in one ordinary day Than they get in all their shopping sprees.</verse>
<verse>At day's end I'm ready for sound sleep, For you, GOD, have put my life back together.</verse>
