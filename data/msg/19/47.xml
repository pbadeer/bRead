<verse>Applause, everyone. Bravo, bravissimo! Shout God--songs at the top of your lungs!</verse>
<verse>GOD Most High is stunning, astride land and ocean.</verse>
<verse>He crushes hostile people, puts nations at our feet.</verse>
<verse>He set us at the head of the line, prize-winning Jacob, his favorite.</verse>
<verse>Loud cheers as God climbs the mountain, a ram's horn blast at the summit.</verse>
<verse>Sing songs to God, sing out! Sing to our King, sing praise!</verse>
<verse>He's Lord over earth, so sing your best songs to God.</verse>
<verse>God is Lord of godless nations--sovereign, he's King of the mountain.</verse>
<verse>Princes from all over are gathered, people of Abraham's God. The powers of earth are God's--he soars over all. A psalm of the sons of Korah</verse>
