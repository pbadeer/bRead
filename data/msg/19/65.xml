<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="65">
<verse>Silence is praise to you, Zion--dwelling God, And also obedience.</verse>
<verse>You hear the prayer in it all. We all arrive at your doorstep sooner or later, loaded with guilt,</verse>
<verse>Our sins too much for us--but you get rid of them once and for all.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are the chosen! Blessed the guest at home in your place! We expect our fill of good things in your house, your heavenly manse.</verse>
<verse>All your salvation wonders are on display in your trophy room. Earth-Tamer, Ocean-Pourer,</verse>
<verse>Mountain--Maker, Hill-Dresser,</verse>
<verse>Muzzler of sea storm and wave crash, of mobs in noisy riot--</verse>
<verse>Far and wide they'll come to a stop, they'll stare in awe, in wonder. Dawn and dusk take turns calling, "Come and worship."</verse>
<verse>Oh, visit the earth, ask her to join the dance! Deck her out in spring showers, fill the God--River with living water. Paint the wheat fields golden. Creation was made for this!</verse>
<verse>Drench the plowed fields, soak the dirt clods With rainfall as harrow and rake bring her to blossom and fruit.</verse>
<verse>Snow-crown the peaks with splendor, scatter rose petals down your paths,</verse>
<verse>All through the wild meadows, rose petals. Set the hills to dancing,</verse>
<verse>Dress the canyon walls with live sheep, a drape of flax across the valleys. Let them shout, and shout, and shout! Oh, oh, let them sing!</verse>
