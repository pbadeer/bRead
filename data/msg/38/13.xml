<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Zechariah" book-id="38" n="13">
<verse>"On the Big Day, a fountain will be opened for the family of David and all the leaders of Jerusalem for washing away their sins, for scrubbing their stained and soiled lives clean.</verse>
<verse>"On the Big Day"--this is GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies speaking--"I will wipe out the store-bought gods, erase their names from memory. People will forget they ever heard of them. And I'll get rid of the prophets who polluted the air with their diseased words.</verse>
<verse>If anyone dares persist in spreading diseased, polluting words, his very own parents will step in and say, "That's it! You're finished! Your lies about GOD put everyone in danger,' and then they'll stab him to death in the very act of prophesying lies about GOD-his own parents, mind you!</verse>
<verse>"On the Big Day, the lying prophets will be publicly exposed and humiliated. Then they'll wish they'd never swindled people with their "visions.' No more masquerading in prophet clothes.</verse>
<verse>But they'll deny they've even heard of such things: "Me, a prophet? Not me. I'm a farmer--grew up on the farm.'</verse>
<verse>And if someone says, "And so where did you get that black eye?' they'll say, "I ran into a door at a friend's house.'</verse>
<verse>[JC] "Sword, get moving against my shepherd, against my close associate!" Decree of GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies. "Kill the shepherd! Scatter the sheep! The back of my hand against even the lambs!</verse>
<verse>All across the country"--GOD's Decree--"two-thirds will be devastated and one-third survive.</verse>
<verse>I'll deliver the surviving third to the refinery fires. I'll refine them as silver is refined, test them for purity as gold is tested. Then they'll pray to me by name and I'll answer them personally. I'll say, "That's my people.' They'll say, "GOD-my God!'"</verse>
