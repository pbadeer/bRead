<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Zechariah" book_id="38" n="2">
<verse>I looked up and was surprised to see a man holding a tape measure in his hand.</verse>
<verse>I said, "What are you up to?I'm on my way," he said, "to survey Jerusalem, to measure its width and length."</verse>
<verse>Just then the Messenger-Angel on his way out met another angel coming in</verse>
<verse>and said, "Run! Tell the Surveyor, "Jerusalem will burst its walls--bursting with people, bursting with animals.</verse>
<verse>And I'll be right there with her'--GOD's Decree--"a wall of fire around unwalled Jerusalem and a radiant presence within.'" [JC]</verse>
<verse>"Up on your feet! Get out of there--and now!" GOD says so. "Return from your far exile. I scattered you to the four winds." GOD's Decree.</verse>
<verse>"Escape from Babylon, Zion, and come home--now!" [JC]</verse>
<verse>GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies, the One of Glory who sent me on my mission, commenting on the godless nations who stripped you and left you homeless, said, "Anyone who hits you, hits me--bloodies my nose, blackens my eye.</verse>
<verse>Yes, and at the right time I'll give the signal and they'll be stripped and thrown out by their own servants." Then you'll know for sure that GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me on this mission. [JC]</verse>
<verse>"Shout and celebrate, Daughter of Zion! I'm on my way. I'm moving into your neighborhood!" GOD's Decree. [JC]</verse>
<verse>Many godless nations will be linked up with GOD at that time. ("They will become my family! I'll live in their homes!") And then you'll know for sure that GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me on this mission.</verse>
<verse>GOD will reclaim his Judah inheritance in the Holy Land. He'll again make clear that Jerusalem is his choice. [JC]</verse>
<verse>Quiet, everyone! Shh! Silence before GOD. Something's afoot in his holy house. He's on the move!</verse>
