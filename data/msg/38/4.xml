<verse>The Messenger-Angel again called me to attention. It was like being wakened out of deep sleep.</verse>
<verse>He said, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top. Seven lamps, each with seven spouts, are set on the bowl.</verse>
<verse>And there are two olive trees, one on either side of the bowl."</verse>
<verse>Then I asked the Messenger-Angel, "What does this mean, sir?"</verse>
<verse>The Messenger-Angel said, "Can't you tell?No, sir," I said. Then he said,</verse>
<verse>"This is GOD's Message to Zerubbabel: "You can't force these things. They only come about through my Spirit,' says GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies.</verse>
<verse>"So, big mountain, who do you think you are? Next to Zerubbabel you're nothing but a molehill. He'll proceed to set the Cornerstone in place, accompanied by cheers: Yes! Yes! Do it!'"</verse>
<verse>After that, the Word of GOD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Zerubbabel started rebuilding this Temple and he will complete it. That will be your confirmation that GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me to you.</verse>
<verse>Does anyone dare despise this day of small beginnings? They'll change their tune when they see Zerubbabel setting the last stone in place!" Going back to the vision, the Messenger-Angel said, "The seven lamps are the eyes of GOD probing the dark corners of the world like searchlights."</verse>
<verse>"And the two olive trees on either side of the lampstand?" I asked. "What's the meaning of them?</verse>
<verse>And while you're at it, the two branches of the olive trees that feed oil to the lamps--what do they mean?"</verse>
<verse>He said, "You haven't figured that out?" I said, "No, sir."</verse>
<verse>He said, "These are the two who stand beside the Master of the whole earth and supply golden lamp oil worldwide."</verse>
