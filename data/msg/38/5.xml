<verse>I looked up again and saw--surprise!-a book on the wing! A book flying!</verse>
<verse>The Messenger-Angel said to me, "What do you see now?" I said, "I see a book flying, a huge book--thirty feet long and fifteen wide!"</verse>
<verse>He told me, "This book is the verdict going out worldwide against thieves and liars. The first half of the book disposes of everyone who steals; the second half takes care of everyone who lies.</verse>
<verse>I launched it"--Decree of GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies--"and so it will fly into the house of every thief and every liar. It will land in each house and tear it down, timbers and stones."</verse>
<verse>The Messenger-Angel appeared and said, "Look up. Tell me what you see."</verse>
<verse>I said, "What in the world is that?" He said, "This is a bushel basket on a journey. It holds the sin of everyone, everywhere."</verse>
<verse>Then the lid made of lead was removed from the basket--and there was a woman sitting in it!</verse>
<verse>He said, "This is Miss Wicked." He pushed her back down into the basket and clamped the lead lid over her.</verse>
<verse>Then I looked up and to my surprise saw two women flying. On outstretched wings they airlifted the bushel basket into the sky.</verse>
<verse>I said to the Messenger-Angel, "Where are they taking the bushel basket?"</verse>
<verse>He said, "East to the land of Shinar. They will build a garage to house it. When it's finished, the basket will be stored there."</verse>
