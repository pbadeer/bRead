<verse>Next the Messenger-Angel showed me the high priest Joshua. He was standing before GOD's Angel where the Accuser showed up to accuse him.</verse>
<verse>Then GOD said to the Accuser, "I, GOD, rebuke you, Accuser! I rebuke you and choose Jerusalem. Surprise! Everything is going up in flames, but I reach in and pull out Jerusalem!"</verse>
<verse>Joshua, standing before the angel, was dressed in dirty clothes.</verse>
<verse>The angel spoke to his attendants, "Get him out of those filthy clothes," and then said to Joshua, "Look, I've stripped you of your sin and dressed you up in clean clothes."</verse>
<verse>I spoke up and said, "How about a clean new turban for his head also?" And they did it--put a clean new turban on his head. Then they finished dressing him, with GOD's Angel looking on.</verse>
<verse>GOD's Angel then charged Joshua,</verse>
<verse>"Orders from GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies: "If you live the way I tell you and remain obedient in my service, then you'll make the decisions around here and oversee my affairs. And all my attendants standing here will be at your service.</verse>
<verse>Careful, High Priest Joshua--both you and your friends sitting here with you, for your friends are in on this, too! Here's what I'm doing next: I'm introducing my servant Branch.</verse>
<verse>And note this: This stone that I'm placing before Joshua, a single stone with seven eyes'--Decree of GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies--"I'll engrave with these words: "I'll strip this land of its filthy sin, all at once, in a single day."</verse>
<verse>At that time, everyone will get along with one another, with friendly visits across the fence, friendly visits on one another's porches.'"</verse>
