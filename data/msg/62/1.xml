<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="1 John" book_id="62" n="1">
<verse>From the very first day, we were there, taking it all in--we heard it with our own ears, saw it with our own eyes, verified it with our own hands.</verse>
<verse>The Word of Life appeared right before our eyes; we saw it happen! And now we're telling you in most sober prose that what we witnessed was, incredibly, this: The infinite Life of God himself took shape before us.</verse>
<verse>We saw it, we heard it, and now we're telling you so you can experience it along with us, this experience of communion with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>Our motive for writing is simply this: We want you to enjoy this, too. Your joy will double our joy!</verse>
<verse>This, in essence, is the message we heard from Christ and are passing on to you: God is light, pure light; there's not a trace of darkness in him.</verse>
<verse>If we claim that we experience a shared life with him and continue to stumble around in the dark, we're obviously lying through our teeth--we're not living what we claim.</verse>
<verse>But if we walk in the light, God himself being the light, we also experience a shared life with one another, as the sacrificed blood of Jesus, God's Son, purges all our sin.</verse>
<verse>If we claim that we're free of sin, we're only fooling ourselves. A claim like that is errant nonsense.</verse>
<verse>On the other hand, if we admit our sins--make a clean breast of them--he won't let us down; he'll be true to himself. He'll forgive our sins and purge us of all wrongdoing.</verse>
<verse>If we claim that we've never sinned, we out-and-out contradict God--make a liar out of him. A claim like that only shows off our ignorance of God.</verse>
