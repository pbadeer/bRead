<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Leviticus" book_id="3" n="8">
<verse>GOD spoke to Moses. He said,</verse>
<verse>"Take Aaron and with him his sons, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the Absolution-Offering, the two rams, and the basket of unraised bread.</verse>
<verse>Gather the entire congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting."</verse>
<verse>Moses did just as GOD commanded him and the congregation gathered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</verse>
<verse>Moses addressed the congregation: "This is what GOD has commanded to be done."</verse>
<verse>Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.</verse>
<verse>He put the tunic on Aaron and tied it around him with a sash. Then he put the robe on him and placed the Ephod on him. He fastened the Ephod with a woven belt, making it snug.</verse>
<verse>He put the Breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the pouch of the Breastpiece.</verse>
<verse>He placed the turban on his head with the gold plate fixed to the front of it, the holy crown, just as GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed The Dwelling and everything that was in it, consecrating them.</verse>
<verse>He sprinkled some of the oil on the Altar seven times, anointing the Altar and all its utensils, the Washbasin and its stand, consecrating them.</verse>
<verse>He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, anointing him and thus consecrating him.</verse>
<verse>Moses brought Aaron's sons forward and put tunics on them, belted them with sashes, and put caps on them, just as GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>Moses brought out the bull for the Absolution-Offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.</verse>
<verse>Moses slaughtered the bull and purified the Altar by smearing the blood on each of the horns of the Altar with his finger. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the Altar. He consecrated it so atonement could be made on it.</verse>
<verse>Moses took all the fat on the entrails and the lobe of liver and the two kidneys with their fat and burned it all on the Altar</verse>
<verse>. The bull with its hide and meat and guts he burned outside the camp, just as GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>Moses presented the ram for the Whole-Burnt-Offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.</verse>
<verse>Moses slaughtered it and splashed the blood against all sides of the Altar.</verse>
<verse>He cut the ram up into pieces and then burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.</verse>
<verse>He washed the entrails and the legs with water and then burned the whole ram on the Altar. It was a Whole-Burnt-Offering, a pleasing fragrance--a gift to GOD just as GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>Moses then presented the second ram, the ram for the Ordination-Offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram's head.</verse>
<verse>Moses slaughtered it and smeared some of its blood on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.</verse>
<verse>Then Aaron's sons were brought forward and Moses smeared some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses threw the remaining blood against each side of the Altar.</verse>
<verse>He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.</verse>
<verse>From the basket of unraised bread that was in the presence of GOD he took one loaf of the unraised bread made with oil and one wafer. He placed these on the fat portions and the right thigh.</verse>
<verse>He put all this in the hands of Aaron and his sons who waved them before GOD as a Wave-Offering.</verse>
<verse>Then Moses took it all back from their hands and burned them on the Altar on top of the Whole-Burnt-Offering. These were the Ordination-Offerings, a pleasing fragrance to GOD, a gift to GOD.</verse>
<verse>Then Moses took the breast and raised it up as a Wave-Offering before GOD; it was Moses' portion from the Ordination-Offering ram, just as GOD had commanded Moses.</verse>
<verse>Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the Altar and sprinkled Aaron and his garments, and his sons and their garments, consecrating Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.</verse>
<verse>Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons: "Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination, just as I commanded, saying, "Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'</verse>
<verse>Burn up the leftovers from the meat and bread.</verse>
<verse>Don't leave through the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for the seven days that will complete your ordination. Your ordination will last seven days.</verse>
<verse>GOD commanded what has been done this day in order to make atonement for you.</verse>
<verse>Stay at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days. Be sure to do what GOD requires, lest you die. This is what I have been commanded."</verse>
<verse>Aaron and his sons did everything that GOD had commanded by Moses.</verse>
