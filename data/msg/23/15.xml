<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="15">
<verse>A Message concerning Moab: Village Ar of Moab is in ruins, destroyed in a night raid. Village Kir of Moab is in ruins, destroyed in a night raid.</verse>
<verse>Village Dibon climbs to its chapel in the hills, goes up to lament. Moab weeps and wails over Nebo and Medba. Every head is shaved bald, every beard shaved clean.</verse>
<verse>They pour into the streets wearing black, go up on the roofs, take to the town square, Everyone in tears, everyone in grief.</verse>
<verse>Towns Heshbon and Elealeh cry long and loud. The sound carries as far as Jahaz. Moab sobs, shaking in grief. The soul of Moab trembles.</verse>
<verse>Oh, how I grieve for Moab! Refugees stream to Zoar and then on to Eglath-shelishiyah. Up the slopes of Luhith they weep; on the road to Horonaim they cry their loss.</verse>
<verse>The springs of Nimrim are dried up--grass brown, buds stunted, nothing grows.</verse>
<verse>They leave, carrying all their possessions on their backs, everything they own, Making their way as best they can across Willow Creek to safety.</verse>
<verse>Poignant cries reverberate all through Moab, Gut-wrenching sobs as far as Eglaim, heart-racking sobs all the way to Beer-elim.</verse>
<verse>The banks of the Dibon crest with blood, but God has worse in store for Dibon: A lion--a lion to finish off the fugitives, to clean up whoever's left in the land.</verse>
