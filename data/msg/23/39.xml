<verse>Sometime later, King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent messengers with greetings and a gift to Hezekiah. He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and was now well.</verse>
<verse>Hezekiah received the messengers warmly. He took them on a tour of his royal precincts, proudly showing them all his treasures: silver, gold, spices, expensive oils, all his weapons--everything out on display. There was nothing in his house or kingdom that Hezekiah didn't show them.</verse>
<verse>Later the prophet Isaiah showed up. He asked Hezekiah, "What were these men up to? What did they say? And where did they come from?" Hezekiah said, "They came from a long way off, from Babylon."</verse>
<verse>"And what did they see in your palace?Everything," said Hezekiah. "I showed them the works, opened all the doors and impressed them with it all."</verse>
<verse>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Now listen to this Message from GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies:</verse>
<verse>I have to warn you, the time is coming when everything in this palace, along with everything your ancestors accumulated before you, will be hauled off to Babylon. GOD says that there will be nothing left. Nothing.</verse>
<verse>And not only your things but your sons. Some of your sons will be taken into exile, ending up as eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."</verse>
<verse>Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, "Good. If GOD says so, it's good." Within himself he was thinking, "But surely nothing bad will happen in my lifetime. I'll enjoy peace and stability as long as I live." MESSAGES OF COMFORT</verse>
