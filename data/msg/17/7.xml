<verse>So the king and Haman went to dinner with Queen Esther.</verse>
<verse>At this second dinner, while they were drinking wine the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what would you like? Half of my kingdom! Just ask and it's yours."</verse>
<verse>Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor in your eyes, O King, and if it please the king, give me my life, and give my people their lives.</verse>
<verse>"We've been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed--sold to be massacred, eliminated. If we had just been sold off into slavery, I wouldn't even have brought it up; our troubles wouldn't have been worth bothering the king over."</verse>
<verse>King Xerxes exploded, "Who? Where is he? This is monstrous!"</verse>
<verse>"An enemy. An adversary. This evil Haman," said Esther. Haman was terror-stricken before the king and queen.</verse>
<verse>The king, raging, left his wine and stalked out into the palace garden. Haman stood there pleading with Queen Esther for his life--he could see that the king was finished with him and that he was doomed.</verse>
<verse>As the king came back from the palace garden into the banquet hall, Haman was groveling at the couch on which Esther reclined. The king roared out, "Will he even molest the queen while I'm just around the corner?" When that word left the king's mouth, all the blood drained from Haman's face.</verse>
<verse>Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, spoke up: "Look over there! There's the gallows that Haman had built for Mordecai, who saved the king's life. It's right next to Haman's house--seventy-five feet high!" The king said, "Hang him on it!"</verse>
<verse>So Haman was hanged on the very gallows that he had built for Mordecai. And the king's hot anger cooled. W+</verse>
