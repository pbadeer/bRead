<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="Revelation" book_id="66" n="15">
<verse>I saw another Sign in Heaven, huge and breathtaking: seven Angels with seven disasters. These are the final disasters, the wrap-up of God's wrath.</verse>
<verse>I saw something like a sea made of glass, the glass all shot through with fire. Carrying harps of God, triumphant over the Beast, its image, and the number of its name, the saved ones stood on the sea of glass.</verse>
<verse>They sang the Song of Moses, servant of God; they sang the Song of the Lamb: Mighty your acts and marvelous, O God, the Sovereign-Strong! Righteous your ways and true, King of the nations!</verse>
<verse>Who can fail to fear you, God, give glory to your Name? Because you and you only are holy, all nations will come and worship you, because they see your judgments are right.</verse>
<verse>Then I saw the doors of the Temple, the Tent of Witness in Heaven, open wide.</verse>
<verse>The Seven Angels carrying the seven disasters came out of the Temple. They were dressed in clean, bright linen and wore gold vests.</verse>
<verse>One of the Four Animals handed the Seven Angels seven gold bowls, brimming with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>Smoke from God's glory and power poured out of the Temple. No one was permitted to enter the Temple until the seven disasters of the Seven Angels were finished.</verse>
