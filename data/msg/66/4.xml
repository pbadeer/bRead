<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="Revelation" book_id="66" n="4">
<verse>Then I looked, and, oh!-a door open into Heaven. The trumpet-voice, the first voice in my vision, called out, "Ascend and enter. I'll show you what happens next."</verse>
<verse>I was caught up at once in deep worship and, oh!-a Throne set in Heaven with One Seated on the Throne,</verse>
<verse>suffused in gem hues of amber and flame with a nimbus of emerald.</verse>
<verse>Twenty-four thrones circled the Throne, with Twenty-four Elders seated, white-robed, gold-crowned.</verse>
<verse>Lightning flash and thunder crash pulsed from the Throne. Seven fire-blazing torches fronted the Throne (these are the Sevenfold Spirit of God).</verse>
<verse>Before the Throne it was like a clear crystal sea. Prowling around the Throne were Four Animals, all eyes. Eyes to look ahead, eyes to look behind.</verse>
<verse>The first Animal like a lion, the second like an ox, the third with a human face, the fourth like an eagle in flight.</verse>
<verse>The Four Animals were winged, each with six wings. They were all eyes, seeing around and within. And they chanted night and day, never taking a break: Holy, holy, holy Is God our Master, Sovereign-Strong, THE WAS, THE IS, THE COMING.</verse>
<verse>Every time the Animals gave glory and honor and thanks to the One Seated on the Throne--the age-after-age Living One--</verse>
<verse>the Twenty-four Elders would fall prostrate before the One Seated on the Throne. They worshiped the age-after-age Living One. They threw their crowns at the foot of the Throne, chanting,</verse>
<verse>Worthy, O Master! Yes, our God! Take the glory! the honor! the power! You created it all; It was created because you wanted it.</verse>
