<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Joshua" book-id="6" n="16">
<verse>The lot for the people of Joseph went from the Jordan near Jericho, east of the spring of Jericho, north through the desert mountains to Bethel.</verse>
<verse>It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz) to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth.</verse>
<verse>It then descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites to the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Sea.</verse>
<verse>This is the region from which the people of Joseph--Manasseh and Ephraim--got their inheritance. [JC]</verse>
<verse>Ephraim's territory by clans: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</verse>
<verse>and then west to the Sea. From Micmethath on the north it turned eastward to Taanath Shiloh and passed along, still eastward, to Janoah.</verse>
<verse>The border then descended from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah; it touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.</verse>
<verse>From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook Kanah and ended at the Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim by clans,</verse>
<verse>including the cities set aside for Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh--all those towns and their villages.</verse>
<verse>But they didn't get rid of the Canaanites who were living in Gezer. Canaanites are still living among the people of Ephraim, but they are made to do forced labor. [JC]</verse>
