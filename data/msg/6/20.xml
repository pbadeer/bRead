<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Joshua" book-id="6" n="20">
<verse>Then GOD spoke to Joshua:</verse>
<verse>"Tell the People of Israel: Designate the asylum-cities, as I instructed you through Moses,</verse>
<verse>so that anyone who kills a person accidentally--that is, unintentionally--may flee there as a safe place of asylum from the avenger of blood.</verse>
<verse>"A person shall escape for refuge to one of these cities, stand at the entrance to the city gate, and lay out his case before the city's leaders. The leaders must then take him into the city among them and give him a place to live with them.</verse>
<verse>"If the avenger of blood chases after him, they must not give him up--he didn't intend to kill the person; there was no history of ill-feeling.</verse>
<verse>He may stay in that city until he has stood trial before the congregation and until the death of the current high priest. Then he may go back to his own home in his hometown from which he fled."</verse>
<verse>They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hills of Naphtali, Shechem in the hills of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hills of Judah.</verse>
<verse>On the other side of the Jordan, east of Jericho, they designated Bezer on the desert plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
<verse>These were the designated cities for the People of Israel and any resident foreigner living among them, so that anyone who killed someone unintentionally could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood without a fair trial before the congregation.</verse>
