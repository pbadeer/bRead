<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book-id="21" n="6">
<verse>I looked long and hard at what goes on around here, and let me tell you, things are bad. And people feel it.</verse>
<verse>There are people, for instance, on whom God showers everything--money, property, reputation--all they ever wanted or dreamed of. And then God doesn't let them enjoy it. Some stranger comes along and has all the fun. It's more of what I'm calling smoke. A bad business.</verse>
<verse>Say a couple have scores of children and live a long, long life but never enjoy themselves--even though they end up with a big funeral! I'd say that a stillborn baby gets the better deal.</verse>
<verse>It gets its start in a mist and ends up in the dark--unnamed.</verse>
<verse>It sees nothing and knows nothing, but is better off by far than anyone living.</verse>
<verse>Even if someone lived a thousand years--make it two thousand!-but didn't enjoy anything, what's the point? Doesn't everyone end up in the same place?</verse>
<verse>We work to feed our appetites; Meanwhile our souls go hungry.</verse>
<verse>So what advantage has a sage over a fool, or over some poor wretch who barely gets by?</verse>
<verse>Just grab whatever you can while you can; don't assume something better might turn up by and by. All it amounts to anyway is smoke. And spitting into the wind.</verse>
<verse>Whatever happens, happens. Its destiny is fixed. You can't argue with fate.</verse>
<verse>The more words that are spoken, the more smoke there is in the air. And who is any better off?</verse>
<verse>And who knows what's best for us as we live out our meager smoke--and-shadow lives? And who can tell any of us the next chapter of our lives?</verse>
