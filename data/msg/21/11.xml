<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book_id="21" n="11">
<verse>Be generous: Invest in acts of charity.	Charity yields high returns.</verse>
<verse>Don't hoard your goods; spread them around. Be a blessing to others. This could be your last night.</verse>
<verse>When the clouds are full of water, it rains. When the wind blows down a tree, it lies where it falls.</verse>
<verse>Don't sit there watching the wind. Do your own work. Don't stare at the clouds. Get on with your life.</verse>
<verse>Just as you'll never understand the mystery of life forming in a pregnant woman, So you'll never understand the mystery at work in all that God does.</verse>
<verse>Go to work in the morning and stick to it until evening without watching the clock. You never know from moment to moment how your work will turn out in the end.</verse>
<verse>Oh, how sweet the light of day, And how wonderful to live in the sunshine!</verse>
<verse>Even if you live a long time, don't take a single day for granted. Take delight in each light-filled hour, Remembering that there will also be many dark days And that most of what comes your way is smoke.</verse>
<verse>You who are young, make the most of your youth. Relish your youthful vigor. Follow the impulses of your heart. If something looks good to you, pursue it. But know also that not just anything goes; You have to answer to God for every last bit of it.</verse>
<verse>Live footloose and fancy free--You won't be young forever. Youth lasts about as long as smoke.</verse>
