<chapter translation="MSG" testament="Old" book="Jonah" book-id="32" n="2">
<verse>Then Jonah prayed to his God from the belly of the fish.</verse>
<verse>He prayed: "In trouble, deep trouble, I prayed to GOD. He answered me. From the belly of the grave I cried, "Help!' You heard my cry.</verse>
<verse>You threw me into ocean's depths, into a watery grave, With ocean waves, ocean breakers crashing over me.</verse>
<verse>I said, "I've been thrown away, thrown out, out of your sight. I'll never again lay eyes on your Holy Temple.'</verse>
<verse>Ocean gripped me by the throat. The ancient Abyss grabbed me and held tight. My head was all tangled in seaweed</verse>
<verse>at the bottom of the sea where the mountains take root. I was as far down as a body can go, and the gates were slamming shut behind me forever--Yet you pulled me up from that grave alive, O GOD, my God!</verse>
<verse>When my life was slipping away, I remembered GOD, And my prayer got through to you, made it all the way to your Holy Temple.</verse>
<verse>Those who worship hollow gods, god-frauds, walk away from their only true love.</verse>
<verse>But I'm worshiping you, GOD, calling out in thanksgiving! And I'll do what I promised I'd do! Salvation belongs to GOD!"</verse>
<verse>Then GOD spoke to the fish, and it vomited up Jonah on the seashore.</verse>
