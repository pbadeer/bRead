<chapter translation="MSG" testament="New" book="1 Thessalonians" book_id="52" n="1">
<verse>I, Paul, together here with Silas and Timothy, send greetings to the church at Thessalonica, Christians assembled by God the Father and by the Master, Jesus Christ. God's amazing grace be with you! God's robust peace!</verse>
<verse>Every time we think of you, we thank God for you. Day and night you're in our prayers</verse>
<verse>as we call to mind your work of faith, your labor of love, and your patience of hope in following our Master, Jesus Christ, before God our Father.</verse>
<verse>It is clear to us, friends, that God not only loves you very much but also has put his hand on you for something special.</verse>
<verse>When the Message we preached came to you, it wasn't just words. Something happened in you. The Holy Spirit put steel in your convictions. You paid careful attention to the way we lived among you,</verse>
<verse>and determined to live that way yourselves. In imitating us, you imitated the Master. Although great trouble accompanied the Word, you were able to take great joy from the Holy Spirit!-taking the trouble with the joy, the joy with the trouble.</verse>
<verse>Do you know that all over the provinces of both Macedonia and Achaia believers look up to you?</verse>
<verse>The word has gotten around. Your lives are echoing the Master's Word, not only in the provinces but all over the place. The news of your faith in God is out. We don't even have to say anything anymore--you're the message!</verse>
<verse>People come up and tell us how you received us with open arms, how you deserted the dead idols of your old life so you could embrace and serve God, the true God.</verse>
<verse>They marvel at how expectantly you await the arrival of his Son, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescued us from certain doom.</verse>
