<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Zechariah" book_id="38" n="3">
<verse>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.</verse>
<verse>The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?"</verse>
<verse>Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.</verse>
<verse>The angel said to those who were standing before him, "Take off his filthy clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you."</verse>
<verse>Then I said, "Put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
<verse>The angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:</verse>
<verse>"This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'If you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.</verse>
<verse>"'Listen, O high priest Joshua and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.</verse>
<verse>See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the LORD Almighty, 'and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.</verse>
<verse>"'In that day each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree,' declares the LORD Almighty."</verse>
