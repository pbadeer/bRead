<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Zechariah" book-id="38" n="2">
<verse>Then I looked up-and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand!</verse>
<verse>I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is."</verse>
<verse>Then the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel came to meet him</verse>
<verse>and said to him: "Run, tell that young man, 'Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it.</verse>
<verse>And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,' declares the LORD, 'and I will be its glory within.'</verse>
<verse>"Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven," declares the LORD.</verse>
<verse>"Come, O Zion! Escape, you who live in the Daughter of Babylon!"</verse>
<verse>For this is what the LORD Almighty says: "After he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered you-for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye-</verse>
<verse>I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me.</verse>
<verse>"Shout and be glad, O Daughter of Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you," declares the LORD.</verse>
<verse>"Many nations will be joined with the LORD in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>Be still before the LORD, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling."</verse>
