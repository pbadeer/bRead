<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Titus" book_id="56" n="2">
<verse>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.</verse>
<verse>Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.</verse>
<verse>Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.</verse>
<verse>Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</verse>
<verse>to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</verse>
<verse>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.</verse>
<verse>In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness</verse>
<verse>and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
<verse>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,</verse>
<verse>and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</verse>
<verse>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.</verse>
<verse>It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,</verse>
<verse>while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.</verse>
<verse>These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</verse>
