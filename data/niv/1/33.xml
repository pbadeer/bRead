<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Genesis" book-id="1" n="33">
<verse>Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.</verse>
<verse>He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.</verse>
<verse>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</verse>
<verse>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.</verse>
<verse>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."</verse>
<verse>Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.</verse>
<verse>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</verse>
<verse>Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.</verse>
<verse>But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."</verse>
<verse>"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.</verse>
<verse>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</verse>
<verse>Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."</verse>
<verse>But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</verse>
<verse>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."</verse>
<verse>Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you.But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."</verse>
<verse>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.</verse>
<verse>Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.</verse>
<verse>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.</verse>
<verse>For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.</verse>
<verse>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.</verse>
