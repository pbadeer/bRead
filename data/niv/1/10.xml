<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Genesis" book-id="1" n="10">
<verse>This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, who themselves had sons after the flood. The Japhethites</verse>
<verse>The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras.</verse>
<verse>The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.</verse>
<verse>The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim and the Rodanim.</verse>
<verse>(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.) The Hamites</verse>
<verse>The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan.</verse>
<verse>The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.</verse>
<verse>Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.</verse>
<verse>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD."</verse>
<verse>The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar.</verse>
<verse>From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah</verse>
<verse>and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.</verse>
<verse>Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,</verse>
<verse>Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.</verse>
<verse>Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,</verse>
<verse>Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,</verse>
<verse>Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,</verse>
<verse>Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered</verse>
<verse>and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.</verse>
<verse>These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. The Semites</verse>
<verse>Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.</verse>
<verse>The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.</verse>
<verse>The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech.</verse>
<verse>Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.</verse>
<verse>Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.</verse>
<verse>Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,</verse>
<verse>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,</verse>
<verse>Obal, Abimael, Sheba,</verse>
<verse>Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.</verse>
<verse>The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.</verse>
<verse>These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</verse>
<verse>These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.</verse>
