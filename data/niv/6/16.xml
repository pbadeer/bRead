<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Joshua" book-id="6" n="16">
<verse>The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.</verse>
<verse>It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,</verse>
<verse>descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.</verse>
<verse>So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.</verse>
<verse>This was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</verse>
<verse>and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.</verse>
<verse>Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.</verse>
<verse>From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.</verse>
<verse>It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.</verse>
<verse>They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.</verse>
