<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="4">
<verse>In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"</verse>
<verse>In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.</verse>
<verse>Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.</verse>
<verse>Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.</verse>
<verse>It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.</verse>
