<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="18">
<verse>Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush,</verse>
<verse>which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.</verse>
<verse>All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.</verse>
<verse>This is what the LORD says to me: "I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."</verse>
<verse>For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.</verse>
<verse>They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.</verse>
<verse>At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers- the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD Almighty.</verse>
