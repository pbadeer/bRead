<verse>In that day you will say: "I will praise you, O LORD. Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.</verse>
<verse>Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD, is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation."</verse>
<verse>With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.</verse>
<verse>In that day you will say: "Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world.</verse>
<verse>Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you."</verse>
