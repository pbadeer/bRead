<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="32">
<verse>See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.</verse>
<verse>Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.</verse>
<verse>Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.</verse>
<verse>The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.</verse>
<verse>No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.</verse>
<verse>For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil: He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.</verse>
<verse>The scoundrel's methods are wicked, he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.</verse>
<verse>But the noble man makes noble plans, and by noble deeds he stands.</verse>
<verse>You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say!</verse>
<verse>In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come.</verse>
<verse>Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your clothes, put sackcloth around your waists.</verse>
<verse>Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines</verse>
<verse>and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers- yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.</verse>
<verse>The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,</verse>
<verse>till the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest.</verse>
<verse>Justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field.</verse>
<verse>The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.</verse>
<verse>My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.</verse>
<verse>Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,</verse>
<verse>how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.</verse>
