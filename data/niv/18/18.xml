<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="18">
<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
<verse>"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.</verse>
<verse>Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?</verse>
<verse>You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</verse>
<verse>"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.</verse>
<verse>The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.</verse>
<verse>The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.</verse>
<verse>His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.</verse>
<verse>A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.</verse>
<verse>A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.</verse>
<verse>Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.</verse>
<verse>Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.</verse>
<verse>It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.</verse>
<verse>He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.</verse>
<verse>Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.</verse>
<verse>His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.</verse>
<verse>The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.</verse>
<verse>He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.</verse>
<verse>He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.</verse>
<verse>Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.</verse>
<verse>Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."</verse>
