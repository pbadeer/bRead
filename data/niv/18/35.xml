<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="35">
<verse>Then Elihu said:</verse>
<verse>"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God. '</verse>
<verse>Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'</verse>
<verse>"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</verse>
<verse>Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</verse>
<verse>If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</verse>
<verse>If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</verse>
<verse>Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</verse>
<verse>"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</verse>
<verse>But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</verse>
<verse>who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'</verse>
<verse>He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</verse>
<verse>How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</verse>
<verse>and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.</verse>
<verse>So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</verse>
