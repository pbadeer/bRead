<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="37">
<verse>"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</verse>
<verse>Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</verse>
<verse>He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.</verse>
<verse>After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.</verse>
<verse>God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.</verse>
<verse>He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.'</verse>
<verse>So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor.</verse>
<verse>The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.</verse>
<verse>The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.</verse>
<verse>The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.</verse>
<verse>He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.</verse>
<verse>At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.</verse>
<verse>He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love.</verse>
<verse>"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.</verse>
<verse>Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?</verse>
<verse>Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
<verse>You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</verse>
<verse>can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</verse>
<verse>"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</verse>
<verse>Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?</verse>
<verse>Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</verse>
<verse>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.</verse>
<verse>The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.</verse>
<verse>Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? "</verse>
