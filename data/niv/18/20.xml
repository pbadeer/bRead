<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="20">
<verse>Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</verse>
<verse>"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.</verse>
<verse>I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.</verse>
<verse>"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,</verse>
<verse>that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.</verse>
<verse>Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,</verse>
<verse>he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'</verse>
<verse>Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.</verse>
<verse>The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.</verse>
<verse>His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.</verse>
<verse>The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.</verse>
<verse>"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,</verse>
<verse>though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,</verse>
<verse>yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.</verse>
<verse>He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.</verse>
<verse>He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.</verse>
<verse>He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.</verse>
<verse>What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.</verse>
<verse>For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.</verse>
<verse>"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.</verse>
<verse>Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.</verse>
<verse>In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.</verse>
<verse>When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.</verse>
<verse>Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.</verse>
<verse>He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;</verse>
<verse>total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.</verse>
<verse>The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.</verse>
<verse>A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.</verse>
<verse>Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God."</verse>
