<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="23">
<verse>Then Job replied:</verse>
<verse>"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</verse>
<verse>If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!</verse>
<verse>I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
<verse>I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.</verse>
<verse>Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.</verse>
<verse>There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</verse>
<verse>"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.</verse>
<verse>When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.</verse>
<verse>But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.</verse>
<verse>My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.</verse>
<verse>I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.</verse>
<verse>"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.</verse>
<verse>He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.</verse>
<verse>That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.</verse>
<verse>God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.</verse>
<verse>Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</verse>
