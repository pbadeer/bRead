<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="17">
<verse>My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.</verse>
<verse>Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.</verse>
<verse>"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?</verse>
<verse>You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.</verse>
<verse>If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.</verse>
<verse>"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.</verse>
<verse>My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.</verse>
<verse>Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.</verse>
<verse>Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.</verse>
<verse>"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.</verse>
<verse>My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.</verse>
<verse>These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.'</verse>
<verse>If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</verse>
<verse>if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,'</verse>
<verse>where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?</verse>
<verse>Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"</verse>
