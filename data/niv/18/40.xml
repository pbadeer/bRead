<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="40">
<verse>The LORD said to Job:</verse>
<verse>"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</verse>
<verse>Then Job answered the LORD:</verse>
<verse>"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</verse>
<verse>I spoke once, but I have no answer- twice, but I will say no more."</verse>
<verse>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</verse>
<verse>"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</verse>
<verse>"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</verse>
<verse>Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</verse>
<verse>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</verse>
<verse>Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</verse>
<verse>look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</verse>
<verse>Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</verse>
<verse>Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</verse>
<verse>"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</verse>
<verse>What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</verse>
<verse>His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</verse>
<verse>His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</verse>
<verse>He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</verse>
<verse>The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</verse>
<verse>Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</verse>
<verse>The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</verse>
<verse>When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</verse>
<verse>Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?</verse>
