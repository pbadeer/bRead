<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="25">
<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
<verse>"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.</verse>
<verse>Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?</verse>
<verse>How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?</verse>
<verse>If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,</verse>
<verse>how much less man, who is but a maggot- a son of man, who is only a worm!"</verse>
