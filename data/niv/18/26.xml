<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="26">
<verse>Then Job replied:</verse>
<verse>"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</verse>
<verse>What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!</verse>
<verse>Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</verse>
<verse>"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</verse>
<verse>Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.</verse>
<verse>He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.</verse>
<verse>He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.</verse>
<verse>He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.</verse>
<verse>He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
<verse>The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.</verse>
<verse>By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.</verse>
<verse>By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.</verse>
<verse>And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"</verse>
