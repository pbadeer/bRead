<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="38">
<verse>Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said:</verse>
<verse>"Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?</verse>
<verse>Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</verse>
<verse>"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.</verse>
<verse>Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?</verse>
<verse>On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone-</verse>
<verse>while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?</verse>
<verse>"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,</verse>
<verse>when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,</verse>
<verse>when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,</verse>
<verse>when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?</verse>
<verse>"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,</verse>
<verse>that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?</verse>
<verse>The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.</verse>
<verse>The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.</verse>
<verse>"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?</verse>
<verse>Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</verse>
<verse>Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.</verse>
<verse>"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?</verse>
<verse>Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?</verse>
<verse>Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!</verse>
<verse>"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,</verse>
<verse>which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?</verse>
<verse>What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?</verse>
<verse>Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,</verse>
<verse>to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,</verse>
<verse>to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?</verse>
<verse>Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?</verse>
<verse>From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens</verse>
<verse>when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?</verse>
<verse>"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?</verse>
<verse>Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?</verse>
<verse>Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth?</verse>
<verse>"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?</verse>
<verse>Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?</verse>
<verse>Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?</verse>
<verse>Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens</verse>
<verse>when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?</verse>
<verse>"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions</verse>
<verse>when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?</verse>
<verse>Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?</verse>
