<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="12">
<verse>Then Job replied:</verse>
<verse>"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!</verse>
<verse>But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?</verse>
<verse>"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!</verse>
<verse>Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.</verse>
<verse>The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure- those who carry their god in their hands.</verse>
<verse>"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;</verse>
<verse>or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.</verse>
<verse>Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?</verse>
<verse>In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.</verse>
<verse>Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?</verse>
<verse>Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?</verse>
<verse>"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.</verse>
<verse>What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.</verse>
<verse>If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.</verse>
<verse>To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.</verse>
<verse>He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.</verse>
<verse>He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.</verse>
<verse>He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.</verse>
<verse>He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.</verse>
<verse>He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.</verse>
<verse>He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.</verse>
<verse>He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.</verse>
<verse>He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.</verse>
<verse>They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.</verse>
