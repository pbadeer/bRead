<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="15">
<verse>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
<verse>"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</verse>
<verse>Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?</verse>
<verse>But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.</verse>
<verse>Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
<verse>Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.</verse>
<verse>"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</verse>
<verse>Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</verse>
<verse>What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</verse>
<verse>The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.</verse>
<verse>Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?</verse>
<verse>Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</verse>
<verse>so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?</verse>
<verse>"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?</verse>
<verse>If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,</verse>
<verse>how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!</verse>
<verse>"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</verse>
<verse>what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</verse>
<verse>(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):</verse>
<verse>All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.</verse>
<verse>Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.</verse>
<verse>He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.</verse>
<verse>He wanders about-food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</verse>
<verse>Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,</verse>
<verse>because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,</verse>
<verse>defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.</verse>
<verse>"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,</verse>
<verse>he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.</verse>
<verse>He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.</verse>
<verse>He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.</verse>
<verse>Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.</verse>
<verse>Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.</verse>
<verse>He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.</verse>
<verse>For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.</verse>
<verse>They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."</verse>
