<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Daniel" book-id="27" n="12">
<verse>"At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people-everyone whose name is found written in the book-will be delivered.</verse>
<verse>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.</verse>
<verse>Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.</verse>
<verse>But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge."</verse>
<verse>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.</verse>
<verse>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?"</verse>
<verse>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed."</verse>
<verse>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?"</verse>
<verse>He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.</verse>
<verse>Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.</verse>
<verse>"From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.</verse>
<verse>"As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."</verse>
