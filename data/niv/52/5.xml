<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="1 Thessalonians" book-id="52" n="5">
<verse>Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,</verse>
<verse>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</verse>
<verse>While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</verse>
<verse>But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</verse>
<verse>You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.</verse>
<verse>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.</verse>
<verse>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</verse>
<verse>But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</verse>
<verse>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</verse>
<verse>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.</verse>
<verse>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.</verse>
<verse>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</verse>
<verse>And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.</verse>
<verse>Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.</verse>
<verse>Be joyful always;</verse>
<verse>pray continually;</verse>
<verse>give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>Do not put out the Spirit's fire;</verse>
<verse>do not treat prophecies with contempt.</verse>
<verse>Test everything. Hold on to the good.</verse>
<verse>Avoid every kind of evil.</verse>
<verse>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.</verse>
<verse>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
<verse>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
<verse>I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.</verse>
<verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
