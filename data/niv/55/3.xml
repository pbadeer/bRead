<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="2 Timothy" book_id="55" n="3">
<verse>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.</verse>
<verse>People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
<verse>without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,</verse>
<verse>treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God--</verse>
<verse>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.</verse>
<verse>They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,</verse>
<verse>always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.</verse>
<verse>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.</verse>
<verse>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</verse>
<verse>You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</verse>
<verse>persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</verse>
<verse>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</verse>
<verse>while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
<verse>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,</verse>
<verse>and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</verse>
<verse>so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</verse>
