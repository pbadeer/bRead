<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="2 Timothy" book_id="55" n="1">
<verse>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
<verse>I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</verse>
<verse>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</verse>
<verse>I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</verse>
<verse>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
<verse>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</verse>
<verse>So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</verse>
<verse>who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</verse>
<verse>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</verse>
<verse>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</verse>
<verse>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</verse>
<verse>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</verse>
<verse>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
<verse>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</verse>
<verse>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</verse>
<verse>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</verse>
