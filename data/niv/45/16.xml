<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Romans" book-id="45" n="16">
<verse>I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.</verse>
<verse>I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.</verse>
<verse>Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</verse>
<verse>Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</verse>
<verse>Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.</verse>
<verse>Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.</verse>
<verse>Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.</verse>
<verse>Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</verse>
<verse>Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.</verse>
<verse>Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with them.</verse>
<verse>Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.</verse>
<verse>Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.</verse>
<verse>I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.</verse>
<verse>For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.</verse>
<verse>Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.</verse>
<verse>The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</verse>
<verse>Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.</verse>
<verse>I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.</verse>
<verse>See Footnote</verse>
<verse>Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,</verse>
<verse>but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him--</verse>
<verse>to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.</verse>
