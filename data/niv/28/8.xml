<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book_id="28" n="8">
<verse>"Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the LORD because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.</verse>
<verse>Israel cries out to me, 'O our God, we acknowledge you!'</verse>
<verse>But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.</verse>
<verse>They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction.</verse>
<verse>Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity?</verse>
<verse>They are from Israel! This calf-a craftsman has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria.</verse>
<verse>"They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up.</verse>
<verse>Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like a worthless thing.</verse>
<verse>For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.</verse>
<verse>Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king.</verse>
<verse>"Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning.</verse>
<verse>I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something alien.</verse>
<verse>They offer sacrifices given to me and they eat the meat, but the LORD is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.</verse>
<verse>Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire upon their cities that will consume their fortresses."</verse>
