<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book-id="28" n="11">
<verse>"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.</verse>
<verse>But the more I called Israel, the further they went from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.</verse>
<verse>It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.</verse>
<verse>I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love; I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them.</verse>
<verse>"Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?</verse>
<verse>Swords will flash in their cities, will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans.</verse>
<verse>My people are determined to turn from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will by no means exalt them.</verse>
<verse>"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.</verse>
<verse>I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I am God, and not man- the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath.</verse>
<verse>They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.</verse>
<verse>They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes," declares the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One.</verse>
