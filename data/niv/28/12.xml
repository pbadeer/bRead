<verse>In the womb he grasped his brother's heel; as a man he struggled with God.</verse>

<verse>Ephraim boasts, "I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin."</verse>
<verse>"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed feasts.</verse>
<verse>I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them."</verse>
<verse>Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.</verse>

<verse>The LORD used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him.</verse>
<verse>But Ephraim has bitterly provoked him to anger; his Lord will leave upon him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.</verse>
