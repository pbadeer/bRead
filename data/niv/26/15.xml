<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book_id="26" n="15">
<verse>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, how is the wood of a vine better than that of a branch on any of the trees in the forest?</verse>
<verse>Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?</verse>
<verse>And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?</verse>
<verse>If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?</verse>
<verse>"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD."</verse>
