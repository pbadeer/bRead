<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book_id="26" n="22">
<verse>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices</verse>
<verse>and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,</verse>
<verse>you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.</verse>
<verse>Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.</verse>
<verse>"'See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.</verse>
<verse>In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.</verse>
<verse>You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.</verse>
<verse>In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.</verse>
<verse>In you are those who dishonor their fathers' bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.</verse>
<verse>In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter.</verse>
<verse>In you men accept bribes to shed blood; you take usury and excessive interest and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</verse>
<verse>"'I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.</verse>
<verse>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.</verse>
<verse>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.</verse>
<verse>When you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.'"</verse>
<verse>Then the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.</verse>
<verse>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>As men gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.</verse>
<verse>I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her.</verse>
<verse>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.'"</verse>
<verse>Again the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, say to the land, 'You are a land that has had no rain or showers in the day of wrath.'</verse>
<verse>There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.</verse>
<verse>Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.</verse>
<verse>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.</verse>
<verse>Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says'-when the LORD has not spoken.</verse>
<verse>The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien, denying them justice.</verse>
<verse>"I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none.</verse>
<verse>So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."</verse>
