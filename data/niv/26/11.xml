<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book-id="26" n="11">
<verse>Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.</verse>
<verse>The LORD said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.</verse>
<verse>They say, 'Will it not soon be time to build houses? This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.'</verse>
<verse>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man."</verse>
<verse>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon me, and he told me to say: "This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, O house of Israel, but I know what is going through your mind.</verse>
<verse>You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.</verse>
<verse>"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.</verse>
<verse>You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD.</verse>
<verse>I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you.</verse>
<verse>You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</verse>
<verse>This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.</verse>
<verse>And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you."</verse>
<verse>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"</verse>
<verse>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, your brothers-your brothers who are your blood relatives and the whole house of Israel-are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, 'They are far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.'</verse>
<verse>"Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.'</verse>
<verse>"Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.'</verse>
<verse>"They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.</verse>
<verse>I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.</verse>
<verse>Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
<verse>But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."</verse>
<verse>Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</verse>
<verse>The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.</verse>
<verse>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,</verse>
<verse>and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.</verse>
