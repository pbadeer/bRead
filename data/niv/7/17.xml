<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Judges" book_id="7" n="17">
<verse>Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim</verse>
<verse>said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse-I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!"</verse>
<verse>When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you."</verse>
<verse>So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.</verse>
<verse>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.</verse>
<verse>In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.</verse>
<verse>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,</verse>
<verse>left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
<verse>Micah asked him, "Where are you from?I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."</verse>
<verse>Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food."</verse>
<verse>So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.</verse>
<verse>Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.</verse>
<verse>And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."</verse>
