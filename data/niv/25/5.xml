<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Lamentations" book_id="25" n="5">
<verse>Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace.</verse>
<verse>Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, our homes to foreigners.</verse>
<verse>We have become orphans and fatherless, our mothers like widows.</verse>
<verse>We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.</verse>
<verse>Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.</verse>
<verse>We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</verse>
<verse>Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.</verse>
<verse>Slaves rule over us, and there is none to free us from their hands.</verse>
<verse>We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.</verse>
<verse>Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger.</verse>
<verse>Women have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.</verse>
<verse>Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.</verse>
<verse>Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.</verse>
<verse>The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.</verse>
<verse>Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.</verse>
<verse>The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!</verse>
<verse>Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim</verse>
<verse>for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it.</verse>
<verse>You, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.</verse>
<verse>Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?</verse>
<verse>Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old</verse>
<verse>unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.</verse>
