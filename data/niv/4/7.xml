<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Numbers" book-id="4" n="7">
<verse>When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.</verse>
<verse>Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.</verse>
<verse>They brought as their gifts before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen-an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.</verse>
<verse>The LORD said to Moses,</verse>
<verse>"Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man's work requires."</verse>
<verse>So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.</verse>
<verse>He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,</verse>
<verse>and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.</verse>
<verse>But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.</verse>
<verse>When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.</verse>
