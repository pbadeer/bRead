<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Colossians" book_id="51" n="4">
<verse>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
<verse>Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.</verse>
<verse>And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</verse>
<verse>Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.</verse>
<verse>Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.</verse>
<verse>Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.</verse>
<verse>Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
<verse>He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.</verse>
<verse>My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)</verse>
<verse>Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.</verse>
<verse>Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.</verse>
<verse>I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</verse>
<verse>Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.</verse>
<verse>Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</verse>
<verse>After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
<verse>Tell Archippus: "See to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord."</verse>
<verse>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</verse>
