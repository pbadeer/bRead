<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Jonah" book_id="32" n="2">
<verse>From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God.</verse>
<verse>He said: "In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.</verse>
<verse>You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.</verse>
<verse>I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'</verse>
<verse>The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.</verse>
<verse>To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God.</verse>
<verse>"When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.</verse>
<verse>"Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.</verse>
<verse>But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD."</verse>
<verse>And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</verse>
