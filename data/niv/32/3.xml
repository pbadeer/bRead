<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Jonah" book-id="32" n="3">
<verse>Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:</verse>
<verse>"Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you."</verse>
<verse>Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city-a visit required three days.</verse>
<verse>On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned."</verse>
<verse>The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.</verse>
<verse>When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.</verse>
<verse>Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.</verse>
<verse>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.</verse>
<verse>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish."</verse>
<verse>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.</verse>
