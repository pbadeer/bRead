<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="2 Samuel" book-id="10" n="22">
<verse>David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</verse>
<verse>He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;</verse>
<verse>my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior- from violent men you save me.</verse>
<verse>I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.</verse>
<verse>"The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</verse>
<verse>The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.</verse>
<verse>In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.</verse>
<verse>"The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens shook; they trembled because he was angry.</verse>
<verse>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</verse>
<verse>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</verse>
<verse>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.</verse>
<verse>He made darkness his canopy around him- the dark rain clouds of the sky.</verse>
<verse>Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.</verse>
<verse>The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.</verse>
<verse>He shot arrows and scattered the enemies, bolts of lightning and routed them.</verse>
<verse>The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.</verse>
<verse>"He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.</verse>
<verse>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.</verse>
<verse>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</verse>
<verse>He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.</verse>
<verse>"The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</verse>
<verse>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.</verse>
<verse>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</verse>
<verse>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.</verse>
<verse>"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</verse>
<verse>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</verse>
<verse>You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.</verse>
<verse>You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.</verse>
<verse>With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.</verse>
<verse>"As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.</verse>
<verse>For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?</verse>
<verse>It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.</verse>
<verse>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.</verse>
<verse>He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
<verse>You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great.</verse>
<verse>You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.</verse>
<verse>"I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</verse>
<verse>I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.</verse>
<verse>You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</verse>
<verse>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</verse>
<verse>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them- to the LORD, but he did not answer.</verse>
<verse>I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.</verse>
<verse>"You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me,</verse>
<verse>and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me.</verse>
<verse>They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.</verse>
<verse>"The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!</verse>
<verse>He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,</verse>
<verse>who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.</verse>
<verse>He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever."</verse>
