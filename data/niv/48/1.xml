<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Galatians" book_id="48" n="1">
<verse>Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--</verse>
<verse>and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia:</verse>
<verse>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
<verse>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
<verse>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</verse>
<verse>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
<verse>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</verse>
<verse>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</verse>
<verse>Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
<verse>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</verse>
<verse>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</verse>
<verse>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
<verse>But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased</verse>
<verse>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</verse>
<verse>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</verse>
<verse>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
<verse>I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
<verse>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</verse>
<verse>Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
<verse>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</verse>
<verse>They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</verse>
<verse>And they praised God because of me.</verse>
