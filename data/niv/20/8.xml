<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="8">
<verse>Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?</verse>
<verse>On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;</verse>
<verse>beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:</verse>
<verse>"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.</verse>
<verse>You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.</verse>
<verse>Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.</verse>
<verse>My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.</verse>
<verse>All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.</verse>
<verse>To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.</verse>
<verse>Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,</verse>
<verse>for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</verse>
<verse>"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.</verse>
<verse>To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.</verse>
<verse>Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.</verse>
<verse>By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;</verse>
<verse>by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth.</verse>
<verse>I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.</verse>
<verse>With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.</verse>
<verse>My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.</verse>
<verse>I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,</verse>
<verse>bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.</verse>
<verse>"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works,, before his deeds of old;</verse>
<verse>I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.</verse>
<verse>When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;</verse>
<verse>before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,</verse>
<verse>before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.</verse>
<verse>I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,</verse>
<verse>when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,</verse>
<verse>when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.</verse>
<verse>Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,</verse>
<verse>rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.</verse>
<verse>"Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.</verse>
<verse>Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.</verse>
<verse>For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.</verse>
<verse>But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."</verse>
