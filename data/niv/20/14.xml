<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="14">
<verse>The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down.</verse>
<verse>He whose walk is upright fears the LORD, but he whose ways are devious despises him.</verse>
<verse>A fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them.</verse>
<verse>Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox comes an abundant harvest.</verse>
<verse>A truthful witness does not deceive, but a false witness pours out lies.</verse>
<verse>The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.</verse>
<verse>Stay away from a foolish man, for you will not find knowledge on his lips.</verse>
<verse>The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways, but the folly of fools is deception.</verse>
<verse>Fools mock at making amends for sin, but goodwill is found among the upright.</verse>
<verse>Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joy.</verse>
<verse>The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.</verse>
<verse>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.</verse>
<verse>Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief.</verse>
<verse>The faithless will be fully repaid for their ways, and the good man rewarded for his.</verse>
<verse>A simple man believes anything, but a prudent man gives thought to his steps.</verse>
<verse>A wise man fears the LORD and shuns evil, but a fool is hotheaded and reckless.</verse>
<verse>A quick-tempered man does foolish things, and a crafty man is hated.</verse>
<verse>The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</verse>
<verse>Evil men will bow down in the presence of the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>The poor are shunned even by their neighbors, but the rich have many friends.</verse>
<verse>He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who is kind to the needy.</verse>
<verse>Do not those who plot evil go astray? But those who plan what is good find love and faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.</verse>
<verse>The wealth of the wise is their crown, but the folly of fools yields folly.</verse>
<verse>A truthful witness saves lives, but a false witness is deceitful.</verse>
<verse>He who fears the LORD has a secure fortress, and for his children it will be a refuge.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death.</verse>
<verse>A large population is a king's glory, but without subjects a prince is ruined.</verse>
<verse>A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly.</verse>
<verse>A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.</verse>
<verse>He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.</verse>
<verse>When calamity comes, the wicked are brought down, but even in death the righteous have a refuge.</verse>
<verse>Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning and even among fools she lets herself be known.</verse>
<verse>Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.</verse>
<verse>A king delights in a wise servant, but a shameful servant incurs his wrath.</verse>
