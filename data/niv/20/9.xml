<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="9">
<verse>Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.</verse>
<verse>She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</verse>
<verse>She has sent out her maids, and she calls from the highest point of the city.</verse>
<verse>"Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.</verse>
<verse>"Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.</verse>
<verse>Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.</verse>
<verse>"Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.</verse>
<verse>Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you.</verse>
<verse>Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning.</verse>
<verse>"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</verse>
<verse>For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.</verse>
<verse>If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer."</verse>
<verse>The woman Folly is loud; she is undisciplined and without knowledge.</verse>
<verse>She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,</verse>
<verse>calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way.</verse>
<verse>"Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.</verse>
<verse>"Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!"</verse>
<verse>But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave.</verse>
