<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Jeremiah" book_id="24" n="47">
<verse>This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:</verse>
<verse>This is what the LORD says: "See how the waters are rising in the north; they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out; all who dwell in the land will wail</verse>
<verse>at the sound of the hoofs of galloping steeds, at the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Fathers will not turn to help their children; their hands will hang limp.</verse>
<verse>For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.</verse>
<verse>Gaza will shave her head in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves?</verse>
<verse>"'Ah, sword of the LORD,' you cry, 'how long till you rest? Return to your scabbard; cease and be still.'</verse>
<verse>But how can it rest when the LORD has commanded it, when he has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast?"</verse>
