<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Jeremiah" book-id="24" n="45">
<verse>This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating:</verse>
<verse>"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:</verse>
<verse>You said, 'Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.'"</verse>
<verse>The LORD said, "Say this to him: 'This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land.</verse>
<verse>Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'"</verse>
