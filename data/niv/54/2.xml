<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="1 Timothy" book_id="54" n="2">
<verse>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone--</verse>
<verse>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.</verse>
<verse>This is good, and pleases God our Savior,</verse>
<verse>who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</verse>
<verse>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.</verse>
<verse>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
<verse>I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</verse>
<verse>I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</verse>
<verse>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</verse>
<verse>A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.</verse>
<verse>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.</verse>
<verse>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
<verse>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.</verse>
<verse>But women will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</verse>
