<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="2 Chronicles" book_id="14" n="17">
<verse>Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.</verse>
<verse>He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.</verse>
<verse>The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals</verse>
<verse>but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.</verse>
<verse>The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.</verse>
<verse>His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.</verse>
<verse>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.</verse>
<verse>With them were certain Levites-Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah-and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.</verse>
<verse>They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.</verse>
<verse>Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.</verse>
<verse>Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah</verse>
<verse>and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;</verse>
<verse>next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;</verse>
<verse>next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000.</verse>
<verse>From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;</verse>
<verse>next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.</verse>
<verse>These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</verse>
