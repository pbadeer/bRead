<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Deuteronomy" book_id="5" n="27">
<verse>Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: "Keep all these commands that I give you today.</verse>
<verse>When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the LORD your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.</verse>
<verse>Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, promised you.</verse>
<verse>And when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you today, and coat them with plaster.</verse>
<verse>Build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. Do not use any iron tool upon them.</verse>
<verse>Build the altar of the LORD your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God.</verse>
<verse>Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.</verse>
<verse>And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up."</verse>
<verse>Then Moses and the priests, who are Levites, said to all Israel, "Be silent, O Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the LORD your God.</verse>
<verse>Obey the LORD your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today."</verse>
<verse>On the same day Moses commanded the people:</verse>
<verse>When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
<verse>And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
<verse>The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice:</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol-a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands-and sets it up in secret." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbor secretly." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
<verse>"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</verse>
