<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book_id="21" n="12">
<verse>Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them"-</verse>
<verse>before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;</verse>
<verse>when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;</verse>
<verse>when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;</verse>
<verse>when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.</verse>
<verse>Remember him-before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well,</verse>
<verse>and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.</verse>
<verse>"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"</verse>
<verse>Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.</verse>
<verse>The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.</verse>
<verse>The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails-given by one Shepherd.</verse>
<verse>Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.</verse>
<verse>Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</verse>
<verse>For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</verse>
