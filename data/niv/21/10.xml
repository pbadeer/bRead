<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book-id="21" n="10">
<verse>As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</verse>
<verse>The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.</verse>
<verse>Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.</verse>
<verse>If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.</verse>
<verse>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler:</verse>
<verse>Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.</verse>
<verse>I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.</verse>
<verse>Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</verse>
<verse>Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.</verse>
<verse>If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success.</verse>
<verse>If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</verse>
<verse>Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.</verse>
<verse>At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness-</verse>
<verse>and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming- who can tell him what will happen after him?</verse>
<verse>A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.</verse>
<verse>Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time- for strength and not for drunkenness.</verse>
<verse>If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks.</verse>
<verse>A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</verse>
<verse>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.</verse>
