<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book-id="21" n="3">
<verse>There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:</verse>
<verse>a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,</verse>
<verse>a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,</verse>
<verse>a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,</verse>
<verse>a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,</verse>
<verse>a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,</verse>
<verse>a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,</verse>
<verse>a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.</verse>
<verse>What does the worker gain from his toil?</verse>
<verse>I have seen the burden God has laid on men.</verse>
<verse>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.</verse>
<verse>I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.</verse>
<verse>That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil-this is the gift of God.</verse>
<verse>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.</verse>
<verse>Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.</verse>
<verse>And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment-wickedness was there, in the place of justice-wickedness was there.</verse>
<verse>I thought in my heart, "God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed."</verse>
<verse>I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.</verse>
<verse>Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.</verse>
<verse>All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.</verse>
<verse>Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?"</verse>
<verse>So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?</verse>
