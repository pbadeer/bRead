<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book-id="21" n="4">
<verse>Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors- and they have no comforter.</verse>
<verse>And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.</verse>
<verse>But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</verse>
<verse>And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</verse>
<verse>The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.</verse>
<verse>Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.</verse>
<verse>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</verse>
<verse>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless- a miserable business!</verse>
<verse>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:</verse>
<verse>If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!</verse>
<verse>Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?</verse>
<verse>Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</verse>
<verse>Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.</verse>
<verse>The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.</verse>
<verse>I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.</verse>
<verse>There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</verse>
