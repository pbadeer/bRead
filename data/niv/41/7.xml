<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Mark" book-id="41" n="7">
<verse>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</verse>
<verse>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</verse>
<verse>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</verse>
<verse>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )</verse>
<verse>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"</verse>
<verse>He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
<verse>They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'</verse>
<verse>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."</verse>
<verse>And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!</verse>
<verse>For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'</verse>
<verse>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),</verse>
<verse>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</verse>
<verse>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</verse>
<verse>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</verse>
<verse>Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'"</verse>
<verse>See Footnote</verse>
<verse>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</verse>
<verse>"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?</verse>
<verse>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")</verse>
<verse>He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'</verse>
<verse>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</verse>
<verse>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</verse>
<verse>All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'"</verse>
<verse>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</verse>
<verse>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.</verse>
<verse>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
<verse>"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</verse>
<verse>"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</verse>
<verse>Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</verse>
<verse>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
<verse>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
<verse>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</verse>
<verse>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</verse>
<verse>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!" ).</verse>
<verse>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</verse>
<verse>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</verse>
<verse>People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</verse>
