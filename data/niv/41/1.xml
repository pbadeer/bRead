<chapter translation="NIV" testament="New" book="Mark" book_id="41" n="1">
<verse>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
<verse>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"--</verse>
<verse>"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
<verse>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
<verse>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
<verse>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
<verse>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
<verse>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
<verse>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
<verse>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
<verse>And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
<verse>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</verse>
<verse>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</verse>
<verse>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</verse>
<verse>"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</verse>
<verse>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
<verse>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
<verse>At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
<verse>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</verse>
<verse>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
<verse>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
<verse>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</verse>
<verse>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,</verse>
<verse>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</verse>
<verse>"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</verse>
<verse>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</verse>
<verse>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</verse>
<verse>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
<verse>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
<verse>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</verse>
<verse>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</verse>
<verse>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
<verse>The whole town gathered at the door,</verse>
<verse>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
<verse>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</verse>
<verse>Simon and his companions went to look for him,</verse>
<verse>and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</verse>
<verse>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</verse>
<verse>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
<verse>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
<verse>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</verse>
<verse>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</verse>
<verse>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</verse>
<verse>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
<verse>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</verse>
