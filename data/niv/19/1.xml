<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="1">
<verse>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</verse>
<verse>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
<verse>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.</verse>
<verse>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</verse>
