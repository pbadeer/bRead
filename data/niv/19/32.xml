<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="32">
<verse>Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.</verse>
<verse>When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.</verse>
<verse>For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah</verse>
<verse>Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD "- and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah</verse>
<verse>Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.</verse>
<verse>You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah</verse>
<verse>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.</verse>
<verse>Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.</verse>
<verse>Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.</verse>
<verse>Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!</verse>
