<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="24">
<verse>The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;</verse>
<verse>for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.</verse>
<verse>Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?</verse>
<verse>He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false.</verse>
<verse>He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from God his Savior.</verse>
<verse>Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, O God of Jacob. Selah</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</verse>
<verse>Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</verse>
<verse>Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD Almighty- he is the King of glory. Selah</verse>
