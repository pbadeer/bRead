<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="72">
<verse>Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.</verse>
<verse>He will judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.</verse>
<verse>The mountains will bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.</verse>
<verse>He will defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; he will crush the oppressor.</verse>
<verse>He will endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.</verse>
<verse>He will be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.</verse>
<verse>In his days the righteous will flourish; prosperity will abound till the moon is no more.</verse>
<verse>He will rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.</verse>
<verse>The desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust.</verse>
<verse>The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.</verse>
<verse>All kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him.</verse>
<verse>For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.</verse>
<verse>He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.</verse>
<verse>He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.</verse>
<verse>Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.</verse>
<verse>Let grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field.</verse>
<verse>May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.</verse>
<verse>This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.</verse>
