<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="28">
<verse>To you I call, O LORD my Rock; do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who have gone down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</verse>
<verse>Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.</verse>
<verse>Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve.</verse>
<verse>Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.</verse>
<verse>Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</verse>
