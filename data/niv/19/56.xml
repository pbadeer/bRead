<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="56">
<verse>Be merciful to me, O God, for men hotly pursue me; all day long they press their attack.</verse>
<verse>My slanderers pursue me all day long; many are attacking me in their pride.</verse>
<verse>When I am afraid, I will trust in you.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?</verse>
<verse>All day long they twist my words; they are always plotting to harm me.</verse>
<verse>They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, eager to take my life.</verse>
<verse>On no account let them escape; in your anger, O God, bring down the nations.</verse>
<verse>Record my lament; list my tears on your scroll - are they not in your record?</verse>
<verse>Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise-</verse>
<verse>in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?</verse>
<verse>I am under vows to you, O God; I will present my thank offerings to you.</verse>
<verse>For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.</verse>
