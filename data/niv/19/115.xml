<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="115">
<verse>Not to us, O LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?"</verse>
<verse>Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.</verse>
<verse>But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.</verse>
<verse>They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;</verse>
<verse>they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell;</verse>
<verse>they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats.</verse>
<verse>Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.</verse>
<verse>O house of Israel, trust in the LORD - he is their help and shield.</verse>
<verse>O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD - he is their help and shield.</verse>
<verse>You who fear him, trust in the LORD - he is their help and shield.</verse>
<verse>The LORD remembers us and will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,</verse>
<verse>he will bless those who fear the LORD - small and great alike.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD make you increase, both you and your children.</verse>
<verse>May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.</verse>
<verse>The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to man.</verse>
<verse>It is not the dead who praise the LORD, those who go down to silence;</verse>
<verse>it is we who extol the LORD, both now and forevermore. Praise the LORD.</verse>
