<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="4">
<verse>Answer me when I call to you, O my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; be merciful to me and hear my prayer.</verse>
<verse>How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods? Selah</verse>
<verse>Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD will hear when I call to him.</verse>
<verse>In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. Selah</verse>
<verse>Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.</verse>
<verse>I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.</verse>
