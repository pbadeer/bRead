<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="19">
<verse>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.</verse>
<verse>Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.</verse>
<verse>There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.</verse>
<verse>Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,</verse>
<verse>which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.</verse>
<verse>It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.</verse>
<verse>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.</verse>
<verse>The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.</verse>
<verse>They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.</verse>
<verse>By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</verse>
<verse>Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults.</verse>
<verse>Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.</verse>
<verse>May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</verse>
