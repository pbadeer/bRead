<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="114">
<verse>When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,</verse>
<verse>Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</verse>
<verse>The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back;</verse>
<verse>the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.</verse>
<verse>Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,</verse>
<verse>you mountains, that you skipped like rams, you hills, like lambs?</verse>
<verse>Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.</verse>
