<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="144">
<verse>Praise be to the LORD my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</verse>
<verse>He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him?</verse>
<verse>Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.</verse>
<verse>Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.</verse>
<verse>Send forth lightning and scatter {the enemies}; shoot your arrows and rout them.</verse>
<verse>Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners</verse>
<verse>whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</verse>
<verse>I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,</verse>
<verse>to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</verse>
<verse>Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.</verse>
<verse>Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;</verse>
<verse>our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are the people of whom this is true; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.</verse>
