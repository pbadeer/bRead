<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="142">
<verse>I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy.</verse>
<verse>I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble.</verse>
<verse>When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me.</verse>
<verse>Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.</verse>
<verse>I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."</verse>
<verse>Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.</verse>
<verse>Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.</verse>
