<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="5">
<verse>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.</verse>
<verse>Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.</verse>
<verse>In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.</verse>
<verse>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.</verse>
<verse>The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.</verse>
<verse>You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors.</verse>
<verse>But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.</verse>
<verse>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies- make straight your way before me.</verse>
<verse>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.</verse>
<verse>Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.</verse>
<verse>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.</verse>
<verse>For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.</verse>
