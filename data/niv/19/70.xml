<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="70">
<verse>Hasten, O God, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.</verse>
<verse>May those who seek my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</verse>
<verse>May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" turn back because of their shame.</verse>
<verse>But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "Let God be exalted!"</verse>
<verse>Yet I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.</verse>
