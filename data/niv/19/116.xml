<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="116">
<verse>I love the LORD, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy.</verse>
<verse>Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.</verse>
<verse>The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave came upon me; I was overcome by trouble and sorrow.</verse>
<verse>Then I called on the name of the LORD: "O LORD, save me!"</verse>
<verse>The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.</verse>
<verse>The LORD protects the simplehearted; when I was in great need, he saved me.</verse>
<verse>Be at rest once more, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you.</verse>
<verse>For you, O LORD, have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling,</verse>
<verse>that I may walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>I believed; therefore I said, "I am greatly afflicted."</verse>
<verse>And in my dismay I said, "All men are liars."</verse>
<verse>How can I repay the LORD for all his goodness to me?</verse>
<verse>I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.</verse>
<verse>Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant; you have freed me from my chains.</verse>
<verse>I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people,</verse>
<verse>in the courts of the house of the LORD - in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.</verse>
