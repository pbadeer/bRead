<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="16">
<verse>Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take refuge.</verse>
<verse>I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing."</verse>
<verse>As for the saints who are in the land, they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight.</verse>
<verse>The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood or take up their names on my lips.</verse>
<verse>LORD, you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.</verse>
<verse>The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.</verse>
<verse>I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.</verse>
<verse>I have set the LORD always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure,</verse>
<verse>because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.</verse>
<verse>You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.</verse>
