<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="13">
<verse>How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?</verse>
<verse>How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?</verse>
<verse>Look on me and answer, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death;</verse>
<verse>my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall.</verse>
<verse>But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.</verse>
<verse>I will sing to the LORD, for he has been good to me.</verse>
