<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="8">
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.</verse>
<verse>From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.</verse>
<verse>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</verse>
<verse>what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</verse>
<verse>You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.</verse>
<verse>You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet:</verse>
<verse>all flocks and herds, and the beasts of the field,</verse>
<verse>the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</verse>
