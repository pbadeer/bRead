<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="43">
<verse>Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from deceitful and wicked men.</verse>
<verse>You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?</verse>
<verse>Send forth your light and your truth, let them guide me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.</verse>
<verse>Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.</verse>
<verse>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</verse>
