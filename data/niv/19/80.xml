<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="80">
<verse>Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth</verse>
<verse>before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O God; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</verse>
<verse>O LORD God Almighty, how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?</verse>
<verse>You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.</verse>
<verse>You have made us a source of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</verse>
<verse>You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.</verse>
<verse>You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.</verse>
<verse>The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.</verse>
<verse>It sent out its boughs to the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.</verse>
<verse>Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?</verse>
<verse>Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it.</verse>
<verse>Return to us, O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,</verse>
<verse>the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.</verse>
<verse>Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.</verse>
<verse>Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.</verse>
<verse>Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O LORD God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</verse>
