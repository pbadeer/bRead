<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="146">
<verse>Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</verse>
<verse>I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</verse>
<verse>Do not put your trust in princes, in mortal men, who cannot save.</verse>
<verse>When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,</verse>
<verse>the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them- the LORD, who remains faithful forever.</verse>
<verse>He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets prisoners free,</verse>
<verse>the LORD gives sight to the blind, the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down, the LORD loves the righteous.</verse>
<verse>The LORD watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the LORD.</verse>
