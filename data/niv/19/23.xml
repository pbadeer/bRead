<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="23">
<verse>The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.</verse>
<verse>He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,</verse>
<verse>he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</verse>
<verse>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</verse>
<verse>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.</verse>
<verse>Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</verse>
