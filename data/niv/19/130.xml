<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="130">
<verse>Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD;</verse>
<verse>O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.</verse>
<verse>If you, O LORD, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?</verse>
<verse>But with you there is forgiveness; therefore you are feared.</verse>
<verse>I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope.</verse>
<verse>My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.</verse>
<verse>He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.</verse>
