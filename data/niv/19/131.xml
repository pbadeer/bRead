<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="131">
<verse>My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.</verse>
<verse>But I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, put your hope in the LORD both now and forevermore.</verse>
