<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="27">
<verse>The LORD is my light and my salvation- whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life- of whom shall I be afraid?</verse>
<verse>When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.</verse>
<verse>Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident.</verse>
<verse>One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.</verse>
<verse>For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.</verse>
<verse>Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me.</verse>
<verse>My heart says of you, "Seek his face!" Your face, LORD, I will seek.</verse>
<verse>Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior.</verse>
<verse>Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.</verse>
<verse>Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.</verse>
<verse>Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.</verse>
<verse>I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.</verse>
