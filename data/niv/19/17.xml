<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="17">
<verse>Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer- it does not rise from deceitful lips.</verse>
<verse>May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.</verse>
<verse>Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.</verse>
<verse>As for the deeds of men- by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</verse>
<verse>My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</verse>
<verse>I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.</verse>
<verse>Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.</verse>
<verse>Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings</verse>
<verse>from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.</verse>
<verse>They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.</verse>
<verse>They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.</verse>
<verse>They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover.</verse>
<verse>Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</verse>
<verse>And I-in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.</verse>
