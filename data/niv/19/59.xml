<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="59">
<verse>Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.</verse>
<verse>See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!</verse>
<verse>O LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah</verse>
<verse>They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</verse>
<verse>See what they spew from their mouths- they spew out swords from their lips, and they say, "Who can hear us?"</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations.</verse>
<verse>O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O God, are my fortress,</verse>
<verse>my loving God. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.</verse>
<verse>But do not kill them, O Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about, and bring them down.</verse>
<verse>For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,</verse>
<verse>consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah</verse>
<verse>They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</verse>
<verse>They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.</verse>
<verse>But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.</verse>
<verse>O my Strength, I sing praise to you; you, O God, are my fortress, my loving God.</verse>
