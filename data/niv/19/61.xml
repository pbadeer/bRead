<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="61">
<verse>Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.</verse>
<verse>From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</verse>
<verse>For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.</verse>
<verse>I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah</verse>
<verse>For you have heard my vows, O God; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.</verse>
<verse>Increase the days of the king's life, his years for many generations.</verse>
<verse>May he be enthroned in God's presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.</verse>
<verse>Then will I ever sing praise to your name and fulfill my vows day after day.</verse>
