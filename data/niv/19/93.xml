<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="93">
<verse>The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and is armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.</verse>
<verse>Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.</verse>
<verse>The seas have lifted up, O LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.</verse>
<verse>Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea- the LORD on high is mighty.</verse>
<verse>Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O LORD.</verse>
