<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="76">
<verse>In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.</verse>
<verse>His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.</verse>
<verse>There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war. Selah</verse>
<verse>You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.</verse>
<verse>Valiant men lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.</verse>
<verse>At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.</verse>
<verse>You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?</verse>
<verse>From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet-</verse>
<verse>when you, O God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah</verse>
<verse>Surely your wrath against men brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.</verse>
<verse>Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.</verse>
<verse>He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.</verse>
