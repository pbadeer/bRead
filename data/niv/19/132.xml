<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="132">
<verse>O LORD, remember David and all the hardships he endured.</verse>
<verse>He swore an oath to the LORD and made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:</verse>
<verse>"I will not enter my house or go to my bed-</verse>
<verse>I will allow no sleep to my eyes, no slumber to my eyelids,</verse>
<verse>till I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."</verse>
<verse>We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar:</verse>
<verse>"Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool-</verse>
<verse>arise, O LORD, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.</verse>
<verse>May your priests be clothed with righteousness; may your saints sing for joy."</verse>
<verse>For the sake of David your servant, do not reject your anointed one.</verse>
<verse>The LORD swore an oath to David, a sure oath that he will not revoke: "One of your own descendants I will place on your throne-</verse>
<verse>if your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever."</verse>
<verse>For the LORD has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling:</verse>
<verse>"This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it-</verse>
<verse>I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor will I satisfy with food.</verse>
<verse>I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will ever sing for joy.</verse>
<verse>"Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one.</verse>
<verse>I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown on his head will be resplendent."</verse>
