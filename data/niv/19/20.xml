<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="20">
<verse>May the LORD answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.</verse>
<verse>May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.</verse>
<verse>May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings. Selah</verse>
<verse>May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.</verse>
<verse>We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests.</verse>
<verse>Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.</verse>
<verse>Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.</verse>
<verse>They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, save the king! Answer us when we call!</verse>
