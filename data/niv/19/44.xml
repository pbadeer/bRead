<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="44">
<verse>We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.</verse>
<verse>With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.</verse>
<verse>It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.</verse>
<verse>You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.</verse>
<verse>I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;</verse>
<verse>but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.</verse>
<verse>In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah</verse>
<verse>But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.</verse>
<verse>You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.</verse>
<verse>You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.</verse>
<verse>You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.</verse>
<verse>You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.</verse>
<verse>You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.</verse>
<verse>My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame</verse>
<verse>at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.</verse>
<verse>All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.</verse>
<verse>Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.</verse>
<verse>But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness.</verse>
<verse>If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,</verse>
<verse>would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?</verse>
<verse>Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.</verse>
<verse>Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.</verse>
<verse>Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?</verse>
<verse>We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.</verse>
<verse>Rise up and help us; redeem us because of your unfailing love.</verse>
