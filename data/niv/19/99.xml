<verse>The LORD reigns, let the nations tremble; he sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake.</verse>
<verse>Great is the LORD in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise your great and awesome name- he is holy.</verse>
<verse>The King is mighty, he loves justice- you have established equity; in Jacob you have done what is just and right.</verse>
<verse>Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy.</verse>
<verse>Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the LORD and he answered them.</verse>
<verse>He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.</verse>
<verse>O LORD our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.</verse>
<verse>Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.</verse>
