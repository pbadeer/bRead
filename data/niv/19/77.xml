<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="77">
<verse>I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</verse>
<verse>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.</verse>
<verse>I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah</verse>
<verse>You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</verse>
<verse>I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</verse>
<verse>I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired:</verse>
<verse>"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</verse>
<verse>Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</verse>
<verse>Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" Selah</verse>
<verse>Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right hand of the Most High."</verse>
<verse>I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</verse>
<verse>I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.</verse>
<verse>Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?</verse>
<verse>You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.</verse>
<verse>With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</verse>
<verse>The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.</verse>
<verse>The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.</verse>
<verse>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.</verse>
<verse>Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.</verse>
<verse>You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</verse>
