<verse>I lift up my eyes to the hills- where does my help come from?</verse>
<verse>My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.</verse>
<verse>He will not let your foot slip- he who watches over you will not slumber;</verse>
<verse>indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.</verse>
<verse>The LORD watches over you- the LORD is your shade at your right hand;</verse>
<verse>the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will keep you from all harm- he will watch over your life;</verse>
<verse>the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.</verse>
