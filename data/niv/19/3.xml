<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="3">
<verse>O LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!</verse>
<verse>Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him." Selah</verse>
<verse>But you are a shield around me, O LORD; you bestow glory on me and lift up my head.</verse>
<verse>To the LORD I cry aloud, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah</verse>
<verse>I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.</verse>
<verse>I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. Selah</verse>
