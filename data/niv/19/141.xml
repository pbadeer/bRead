<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="141">
<verse>O LORD, I call to you; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you.</verse>
<verse>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.</verse>
<verse>Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.</verse>
<verse>Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers; let me not eat of their delicacies.</verse>
<verse>Let a righteous man strike me-it is a kindness; let him rebuke me-it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;</verse>
<verse>their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.</verse>
<verse>They will say, "As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. "</verse>
<verse>But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge-do not give me over to death.</verse>
<verse>Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, from the traps set by evildoers.</verse>
<verse>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.</verse>
