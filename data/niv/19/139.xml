<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="139">
<verse>O LORD, you have searched me and you know me.</verse>
<verse>You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.</verse>
<verse>You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.</verse>
<verse>Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>You hem me in-behind and before; you have laid your hand upon me.</verse>
<verse>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.</verse>
<verse>Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?</verse>
<verse>If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.</verse>
<verse>If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,</verse>
<verse>even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.</verse>
<verse>If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,"</verse>
<verse>even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.</verse>
<verse>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.</verse>
<verse>I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.</verse>
<verse>My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,</verse>
<verse>your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</verse>
<verse>How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!</verse>
<verse>Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you.</verse>
<verse>If only you would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</verse>
<verse>They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.</verse>
<verse>Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you?</verse>
<verse>I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.</verse>
<verse>Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.</verse>
<verse>See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</verse>
