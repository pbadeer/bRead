<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="145">
<verse>I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever.</verse>
<verse>Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.</verse>
<verse>Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.</verse>
<verse>One generation will commend your works to another; they will tell of your mighty acts.</verse>
<verse>They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty, and I will meditate on your wonderful works.</verse>
<verse>They will tell of the power of your awesome works, and I will proclaim your great deeds.</verse>
<verse>They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.</verse>
<verse>All you have made will praise you, O LORD; your saints will extol you.</verse>
<verse>They will tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might,</verse>
<verse>so that all men may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.</verse>
<verse>Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made.</verse>
<verse>The LORD upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.</verse>
<verse>The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time.</verse>
<verse>You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is righteous in all his ways and loving toward all he has made.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</verse>
<verse>He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.</verse>
<verse>The LORD watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.</verse>
<verse>My mouth will speak in praise of the LORD. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.</verse>
