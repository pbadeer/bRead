<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="127">
<verse>Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.</verse>
<verse>In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat- for he grants sleep to those he loves.</verse>
<verse>Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him.</verse>
<verse>Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.</verse>
