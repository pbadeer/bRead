<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="64">
<verse>Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.</verse>
<verse>Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers.</verse>
<verse>They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.</verse>
<verse>They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear.</verse>
<verse>They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see them?"</verse>
<verse>They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.</verse>
<verse>But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.</verse>
<verse>He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.</verse>
<verse>All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.</verse>
<verse>Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him!</verse>
