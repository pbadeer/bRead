<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="11">
<verse>In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain.</verse>
<verse>For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?"</verse>
<verse>The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them.</verse>
<verse>The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates.</verse>
<verse>On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; upright men will see his face.</verse>
