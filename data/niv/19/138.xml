<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="138">
<verse>I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; before the "gods" I will sing your praise.</verse>
<verse>I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word.</verse>
<verse>When I called, you answered me; you made me bold and stouthearted.</verse>
<verse>May all the kings of the earth praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.</verse>
<verse>May they sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great.</verse>
<verse>Though the LORD is on high, he looks upon the lowly, but the proud he knows from afar.</verse>
<verse>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life; you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes, with your right hand you save me.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O LORD, endures forever- do not abandon the works of your hands.</verse>
