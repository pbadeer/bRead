<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="65">
<verse>Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.</verse>
<verse>O you who hear prayer, to you all men will come.</verse>
<verse>When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.</verse>
<verse>You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness, O God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,</verse>
<verse>who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,</verse>
<verse>who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.</verse>
<verse>Those living far away fear your wonders; where morning dawns and evening fades you call forth songs of joy.</verse>
<verse>You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.</verse>
<verse>You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.</verse>
<verse>You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.</verse>
<verse>The grasslands of the desert overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.</verse>
<verse>The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.</verse>
