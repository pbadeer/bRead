<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="75">
<verse>We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near; men tell of your wonderful deeds.</verse>
<verse>You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.</verse>
<verse>When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah</verse>
<verse>To the arrogant I say, 'Boast no more,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horns.</verse>
<verse>Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak with outstretched neck.'"</verse>
<verse>No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.</verse>
<verse>But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</verse>
<verse>In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</verse>
