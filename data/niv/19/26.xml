<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="26">
<verse>Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</verse>
<verse>Test me, O LORD, and try me, examine my heart and my mind;</verse>
<verse>for your love is ever before me, and I walk continually in your truth.</verse>
<verse>I do not sit with deceitful men, nor do I consort with hypocrites;</verse>
<verse>I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.</verse>
<verse>I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, O LORD,</verse>
<verse>proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.</verse>
<verse>I love the house where you live, O LORD, the place where your glory dwells.</verse>
<verse>Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with bloodthirsty men,</verse>
<verse>in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.</verse>
<verse>But I lead a blameless life; redeem me and be merciful to me.</verse>
<verse>My feet stand on level ground; in the great assembly I will praise the LORD.</verse>
