<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="21">
<verse>O LORD, the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give!</verse>
<verse>You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</verse>
<verse>You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.</verse>
<verse>He asked you for life, and you gave it to him- length of days, for ever and ever.</verse>
<verse>Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.</verse>
<verse>Surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.</verse>
<verse>For the king trusts in the LORD; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.</verse>
<verse>At the time of your appearing you will make them like a fiery furnace. In his wrath the LORD will swallow them up, and his fire will consume them.</verse>
<verse>You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.</verse>
<verse>Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed;</verse>
<verse>for you will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength; we will sing and praise your might.</verse>
