<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="149">
<verse>Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints.</verse>
<verse>Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with tambourine and harp.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let the saints rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.</verse>
<verse>May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands,</verse>
<verse>to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,</verse>
<verse>to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron,</verse>
<verse>to carry out the sentence written against them. This is the glory of all his saints. Praise the LORD.</verse>
