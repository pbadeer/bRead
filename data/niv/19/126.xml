<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="126">
<verse>When the LORD brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed.</verse>
<verse>Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."</verse>
<verse>The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.</verse>
<verse>Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.</verse>
<verse>Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy.</verse>
<verse>He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him.</verse>
