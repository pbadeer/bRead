<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="92">
<verse>It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High,</verse>
<verse>to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,</verse>
<verse>to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.</verse>
<verse>For you make me glad by your deeds, O LORD; I sing for joy at the works of your hands.</verse>
<verse>How great are your works, O LORD, how profound your thoughts!</verse>
<verse>The senseless man does not know, fools do not understand,</verse>
<verse>that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, are exalted forever.</verse>
<verse>For surely your enemies, O LORD, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.</verse>
<verse>You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured upon me.</verse>
<verse>My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.</verse>
<verse>The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;</verse>
<verse>planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.</verse>
<verse>They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green,</verse>
<verse>proclaiming, "The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him."</verse>
