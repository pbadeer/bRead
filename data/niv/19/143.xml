<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="143">
<verse>O LORD, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.</verse>
<verse>Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.</verse>
<verse>The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</verse>
<verse>So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.</verse>
<verse>I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.</verse>
<verse>I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah</verse>
<verse>Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.</verse>
<verse>Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you.</verse>
<verse>Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</verse>
<verse>For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.</verse>
<verse>In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.</verse>
