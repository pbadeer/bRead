<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="137">
<verse>By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.</verse>
<verse>There on the poplars we hung our harps,</verse>
<verse>for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</verse>
<verse>How can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land?</verse>
<verse>If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.</verse>
<verse>May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.</verse>
<verse>Remember, O LORD, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. "Tear it down," they cried, "tear it down to its foundations!"</verse>
<verse>O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us-</verse>
<verse>he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</verse>
