<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="84">
<verse>How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty!</verse>
<verse>My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</verse>
<verse>Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young- a place near your altar, O LORD Almighty, my King and my God.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. Selah</verse>
<verse>Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.</verse>
<verse>As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.</verse>
<verse>They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.</verse>
<verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD God Almighty; listen to me, O God of Jacob. Selah</verse>
<verse>Look upon our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.</verse>
<verse>Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.</verse>
<verse>O LORD Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you.</verse>
