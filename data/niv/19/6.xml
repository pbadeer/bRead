<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="6">
<verse>O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</verse>
<verse>Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am faint; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are in agony.</verse>
<verse>My soul is in anguish. How long, O LORD, how long?</verse>
<verse>Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.</verse>
<verse>No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave?</verse>
<verse>I am worn out from groaning; all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.</verse>
<verse>My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.</verse>
<verse>Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.</verse>
<verse>All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.</verse>
