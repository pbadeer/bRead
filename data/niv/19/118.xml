<verse>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</verse>
<verse>Let Israel say: "His love endures forever."</verse>
<verse>Let the house of Aaron say: "His love endures forever."</verse>
<verse>Let those who fear the LORD say: "His love endures forever."</verse>
<verse>In my anguish I cried to the LORD, and he answered by setting me free.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?</verse>
<verse>The LORD is with me; he is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies.</verse>
<verse>It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.</verse>
<verse>It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.</verse>
<verse>All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.</verse>
<verse>They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.</verse>
<verse>They swarmed around me like bees, but they died out as quickly as burning thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off.</verse>
<verse>I was pushed back and about to fall, but the LORD helped me.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.</verse>
<verse>Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous: "The LORD's right hand has done mighty things!</verse>
<verse>The LORD's right hand is lifted high; the LORD's right hand has done mighty things!"</verse>
<verse>I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the LORD has done.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has chastened me severely, but he has not given me over to death.</verse>
<verse>Open for me the gates of righteousness; I will enter and give thanks to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>This is the gate of the LORD through which the righteous may enter.</verse>
<verse>I will give you thanks, for you answered me; you have become my salvation.</verse>
<verse>The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;</verse>
<verse>the LORD has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</verse>
<verse>This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, save us; O LORD, grant us success.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD. From the house of the LORD we bless you.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is God, and he has made his light shine upon us. With boughs in hand, join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.</verse>
<verse>You are my God, and I will give you thanks; you are my God, and I will exalt you.</verse>
<verse>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</verse>
