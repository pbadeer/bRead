<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="101">
<verse>I will sing of your love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing praise.</verse>
<verse>I will be careful to lead a blameless life- when will you come to me? I will walk in my house with blameless heart.</verse>
<verse>I will set before my eyes no vile thing. The deeds of faithless men I hate; they will not cling to me.</verse>
<verse>Men of perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with evil.</verse>
<verse>Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, him will I not endure.</verse>
<verse>My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he whose walk is blameless will minister to me.</verse>
<verse>No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.</verse>
<verse>Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.</verse>
