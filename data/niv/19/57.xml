<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="57">
<verse>Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.</verse>
<verse>I cry out to God Most High, to God, who fulfills {his purpose} for me.</verse>
<verse>He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me; Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts- men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</verse>
<verse>They spread a net for my feet- I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path- but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah</verse>
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.</verse>
<verse>Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.</verse>
<verse>I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.</verse>
<verse>For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</verse>
