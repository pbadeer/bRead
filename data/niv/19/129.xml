<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="129">
<verse>They have greatly oppressed me from my youth- let Israel say-</verse>
<verse>they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.</verse>
<verse>Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.</verse>
<verse>But the LORD is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.</verse>
<verse>May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow;</verse>
<verse>with it the reaper cannot fill his hands, nor the one who gathers fill his arms.</verse>
<verse>May those who pass by not say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."</verse>
