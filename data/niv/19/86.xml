<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="86">
<verse>Hear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.</verse>
<verse>Guard my life, for I am devoted to you. You are my God; save your servant who trusts in you.</verse>
<verse>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I call to you all day long.</verse>
<verse>Bring joy to your servant, for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</verse>
<verse>You are forgiving and good, O Lord, abounding in love to all who call to you.</verse>
<verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD; listen to my cry for mercy.</verse>
<verse>In the day of my trouble I will call to you, for you will answer me.</verse>
<verse>Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.</verse>
<verse>All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord; they will bring glory to your name.</verse>
<verse>For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.</verse>
<verse>Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.</verse>
<verse>I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever.</verse>
<verse>For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths of the grave.</verse>
<verse>The arrogant are attacking me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life- men without regard for you.</verse>
<verse>But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Turn to me and have mercy on me; grant your strength to your servant and save the son of your maidservant.</verse>
<verse>Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</verse>
