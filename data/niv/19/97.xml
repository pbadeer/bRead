<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="97">
<verse>The LORD reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice.</verse>
<verse>Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</verse>
<verse>Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.</verse>
<verse>His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.</verse>
<verse>The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
<verse>The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.</verse>
<verse>All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols- worship him, all you gods!</verse>
<verse>Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>For you, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.</verse>
<verse>Let those who love the LORD hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Light is shed upon the righteous and joy on the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>Rejoice in the LORD, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.</verse>
