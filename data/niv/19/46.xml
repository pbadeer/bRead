<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="46">
<verse>God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.</verse>
<verse>Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,</verse>
<verse>though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. Selah</verse>
<verse>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.</verse>
<verse>God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.</verse>
<verse>Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts.</verse>
<verse>The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah</verse>
<verse>Come and see the works of the LORD, the desolations he has brought on the earth.</verse>
<verse>He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear, he burns the shields with fire.</verse>
<verse>"Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."</verse>
<verse>The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah</verse>
