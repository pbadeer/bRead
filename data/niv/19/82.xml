<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="82">
<verse>God presides in the great assembly; he gives judgment among the "gods":</verse>
<verse>"How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? Selah</verse>
<verse>Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.</verse>
<verse>Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>"They know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.</verse>
<verse>"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.'</verse>
<verse>But you will die like mere men; you will fall like every other ruler."</verse>
<verse>Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.</verse>
