<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="91">
<verse>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</verse>
<verse>I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."</verse>
<verse>Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.</verse>
<verse>He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.</verse>
<verse>You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</verse>
<verse>nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.</verse>
<verse>A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</verse>
<verse>You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>If you make the Most High your dwelling- even the LORD, who is my refuge-</verse>
<verse>then no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent.</verse>
<verse>For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;</verse>
<verse>they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.</verse>
<verse>You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.</verse>
<verse>"Because he loves me," says the LORD, "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.</verse>
<verse>He will call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.</verse>
<verse>With long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation."</verse>
