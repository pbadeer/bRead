<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="95">
<verse>Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods.</verse>
<verse>In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.</verse>
<verse>The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</verse>
<verse>Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;</verse>
<verse>for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
<verse>do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the desert,</verse>
<verse>where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did.</verse>
<verse>For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways."</verse>
<verse>So I declared on oath in my anger, "They shall never enter my rest."</verse>
