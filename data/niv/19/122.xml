<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="122">
<verse>I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."</verse>
<verse>Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.</verse>
<verse>That is where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, to praise the name of the LORD according to the statute given to Israel.</verse>
<verse>There the thrones for judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.</verse>
<verse>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May those who love you be secure.</verse>
<verse>May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels."</verse>
<verse>For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, "Peace be within you."</verse>
<verse>For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.</verse>
