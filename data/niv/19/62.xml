<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="62">
<verse>My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.</verse>
<verse>He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.</verse>
<verse>How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down- this leaning wall, this tottering fence?</verse>
<verse>They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Selah</verse>
<verse>Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from him.</verse>
<verse>He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.</verse>
<verse>Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. Selah</verse>
<verse>Lowborn men are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.</verse>
<verse>Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.</verse>
<verse>One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard: that you, O God, are strong,</verse>
<verse>and that you, O Lord, are loving. Surely you will reward each person according to what he has done.</verse>
