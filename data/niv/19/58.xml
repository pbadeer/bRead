<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="58">
<verse>Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?</verse>
<verse>No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.</verse>
<verse>Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.</verse>
<verse>Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,</verse>
<verse>that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.</verse>
<verse>Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O LORD, the fangs of the lions!</verse>
<verse>Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted.</verse>
<verse>Like a slug melting away as it moves along, like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun.</verse>
<verse>Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns- whether they be green or dry-the wicked will be swept away.</verse>
<verse>The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Then men will say, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth."</verse>
