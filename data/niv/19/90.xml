<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="90">
<verse>Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.</verse>
<verse>Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</verse>
<verse>You turn men back to dust, saying, "Return to dust, O sons of men."</verse>
<verse>For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.</verse>
<verse>You sweep men away in the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of the morning-</verse>
<verse>though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is dry and withered.</verse>
<verse>We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.</verse>
<verse>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.</verse>
<verse>All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.</verse>
<verse>The length of our days is seventy years- or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</verse>
<verse>Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.</verse>
<verse>Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</verse>
<verse>Relent, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.</verse>
<verse>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</verse>
<verse>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.</verse>
<verse>May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.</verse>
<verse>May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us- yes, establish the work of our hands.</verse>
