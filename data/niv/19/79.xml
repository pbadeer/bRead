<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="79">
<verse>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</verse>
<verse>They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.</verse>
<verse>They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.</verse>
<verse>We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.</verse>
<verse>How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?</verse>
<verse>Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;</verse>
<verse>for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.</verse>
<verse>Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.</verse>
<verse>Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.</verse>
<verse>Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.</verse>
<verse>May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.</verse>
<verse>Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.</verse>
<verse>Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.</verse>
