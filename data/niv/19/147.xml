<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="147">
<verse>Praise the LORD. How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him!</verse>
<verse>The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel.</verse>
<verse>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</verse>
<verse>He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.</verse>
<verse>Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.</verse>
<verse>The LORD sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music to our God on the harp.</verse>
<verse>He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with rain and makes grass grow on the hills.</verse>
<verse>He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call.</verse>
<verse>His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of a man;</verse>
<verse>the LORD delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.</verse>
<verse>Extol the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion,</verse>
<verse>for he strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you.</verse>
<verse>He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.</verse>
<verse>He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly.</verse>
<verse>He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes.</verse>
<verse>He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast?</verse>
<verse>He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.</verse>
<verse>He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel.</verse>
<verse>He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the LORD.</verse>
