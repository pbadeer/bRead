<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="81">
<verse>Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob!</verse>
<verse>Begin the music, strike the tambourine, play the melodious harp and lyre.</verse>
<verse>Sound the ram's horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our Feast;</verse>
<verse>this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>He established it as a statute for Joseph when he went out against Egypt, where we heard a language we did not understand.</verse>
<verse>He says, "I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.</verse>
<verse>In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah</verse>
<verse>"Hear, O my people, and I will warn you- if you would but listen to me, O Israel!</verse>
<verse>You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not bow down to an alien god.</verse>
<verse>I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.</verse>
<verse>"But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.</verse>
<verse>So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.</verse>
<verse>"If my people would but listen to me, if Israel would follow my ways,</verse>
<verse>how quickly would I subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!</verse>
<verse>Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.</verse>
<verse>But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."</verse>
