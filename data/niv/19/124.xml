<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="124">
<verse>If the LORD had not been on our side- let Israel say-</verse>
<verse>if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,</verse>
<verse>when their anger flared against us, they would have swallowed us alive;</verse>
<verse>the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us,</verse>
<verse>the raging waters would have swept us away.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.</verse>
<verse>We have escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.</verse>
<verse>Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.</verse>
