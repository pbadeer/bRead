<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="103">
<verse>Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits-</verse>
<verse>who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</verse>
<verse>who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</verse>
<verse>who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</verse>
<verse>The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.</verse>
<verse>He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</verse>
<verse>The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</verse>
<verse>He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</verse>
<verse>he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</verse>
<verse>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</verse>
<verse>as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</verse>
<verse>As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</verse>
<verse>for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</verse>
<verse>As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field;</verse>
<verse>the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</verse>
<verse>But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD's love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children-</verse>
<verse>with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</verse>
