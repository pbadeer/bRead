<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="12">
<verse>Help, LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.</verse>
<verse>Everyone lies to his neighbor; their flattering lips speak with deception.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue</verse>
<verse>that says, "We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips -who is our master?"</verse>
<verse>"Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will protect them from those who malign them."</verse>
<verse>And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people forever.</verse>
<verse>The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honored among men.</verse>
