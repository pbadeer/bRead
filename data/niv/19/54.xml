<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="54">
<verse>Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.</verse>
<verse>Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.</verse>
<verse>Strangers are attacking me; ruthless men seek my life- men without regard for God. Selah</verse>
<verse>Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.</verse>
<verse>Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.</verse>
<verse>I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, O LORD, for it is good.</verse>
<verse>For he has delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.</verse>
