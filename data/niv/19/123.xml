<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="123">
<verse>I lift up my eyes to you, to you whose throne is in heaven.</verse>
<verse>As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he shows us his mercy.</verse>
<verse>Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt.</verse>
<verse>We have endured much ridicule from the proud, much contempt from the arrogant.</verse>
