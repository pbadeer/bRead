<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="133">
<verse>How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!</verse>
<verse>It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down upon the collar of his robes.</verse>
<verse>It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.</verse>
