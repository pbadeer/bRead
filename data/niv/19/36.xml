<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="36">
<verse>An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes.</verse>
<verse>For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.</verse>
<verse>The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.</verse>
<verse>Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.</verse>
<verse>Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</verse>
<verse>Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.</verse>
<verse>How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings.</verse>
<verse>They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.</verse>
<verse>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.</verse>
<verse>Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</verse>
<verse>See how the evildoers lie fallen- thrown down, not able to rise!</verse>
