<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="48">
<verse>Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.</verse>
<verse>It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.</verse>
<verse>God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.</verse>
<verse>When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,</verse>
<verse>they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror.</verse>
<verse>Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.</verse>
<verse>You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.</verse>
<verse>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever. Selah</verse>
<verse>Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.</verse>
<verse>Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.</verse>
<verse>Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.</verse>
<verse>Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,</verse>
<verse>consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.</verse>
<verse>For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end.</verse>
