<verse>He has set his foundation on the holy mountain;</verse>
<verse>the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Glorious things are said of you, O city of God: Selah</verse>
<verse>"I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me- Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush - and will say, 'This one was born in Zion.'"</verse>
<verse>Indeed, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her."</verse>
<verse>The LORD will write in the register of the peoples: "This one was born in Zion." Selah</verse>
<verse>As they make music they will sing, "All my fountains are in you."</verse>
