<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="110">
<verse>The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."</verse>
<verse>The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; you will rule in the midst of your enemies.</verse>
<verse>Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy majesty, from the womb of the dawn you will receive the dew of your youth.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
<verse>The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.</verse>
<verse>He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.</verse>
<verse>He will drink from a brook beside the way; therefore he will lift up his head.</verse>
