<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="88">
<verse>O LORD, the God who saves me, day and night I cry out before you.</verse>
<verse>May my prayer come before you; turn your ear to my cry.</verse>
<verse>For my soul is full of trouble and my life draws near the grave.</verse>
<verse>I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like a man without strength.</verse>
<verse>I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care.</verse>
<verse>You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.</verse>
<verse>Your wrath lies heavily upon me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah</verse>
<verse>You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape;</verse>
<verse>my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you, O LORD, every day; I spread out my hands to you.</verse>
<verse>Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do those who are dead rise up and praise you? Selah</verse>
<verse>Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction?</verse>
<verse>Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?</verse>
<verse>But I cry to you for help, O LORD; in the morning my prayer comes before you.</verse>
<verse>Why, O LORD, do you reject me and hide your face from me?</verse>
<verse>From my youth I have been afflicted and close to death; I have suffered your terrors and am in despair.</verse>
<verse>Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.</verse>
<verse>All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.</verse>
<verse>You have taken my companions and loved ones from me; the darkness is my closest friend.</verse>
