<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="52">
<verse>Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?</verse>
<verse>Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.</verse>
<verse>You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah</verse>
<verse>You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue!</verse>
<verse>Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</verse>
<verse>The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at him, saying,</verse>
<verse>"Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!"</verse>
<verse>But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever.</verse>
<verse>I will praise you forever for what you have done; in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints.</verse>
