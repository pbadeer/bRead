<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="83">
<verse>O God, do not keep silent; be not quiet, O God, be not still.</verse>
<verse>See how your enemies are astir, how your foes rear their heads.</verse>
<verse>With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.</verse>
<verse>"Come," they say, "let us destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more."</verse>
<verse>With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you-</verse>
<verse>the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,</verse>
<verse>Gebal, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.</verse>
<verse>Even Assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of Lot. Selah</verse>
<verse>Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,</verse>
<verse>who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground.</verse>
<verse>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,</verse>
<verse>who said, "Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God."</verse>
<verse>Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.</verse>
<verse>As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,</verse>
<verse>so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.</verse>
<verse>Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.</verse>
<verse>Let them know that you, whose name is the LORD - that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.</verse>
