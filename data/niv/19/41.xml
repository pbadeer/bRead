<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="41">
<verse>Blessed is he who has regard for the weak; the LORD delivers him in times of trouble.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will protect him and preserve his life; he will bless him in the land and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness.</verse>
<verse>I said, "O LORD, have mercy on me; heal me, for I have sinned against you."</verse>
<verse>My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die and his name perish?"</verse>
<verse>Whenever one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it abroad.</verse>
<verse>All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,</verse>
<verse>"A vile disease has beset him; he will never get up from the place where he lies."</verse>
<verse>Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, have mercy on me; raise me up, that I may repay them.</verse>
<verse>I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.</verse>
<verse>In my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.</verse>
