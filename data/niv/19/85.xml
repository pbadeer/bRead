<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="85">
<verse>You showed favor to your land, O LORD; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins. Selah</verse>
<verse>You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.</verse>
<verse>Restore us again, O God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.</verse>
<verse>Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?</verse>
<verse>Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?</verse>
<verse>Show us your unfailing love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.</verse>
<verse>I will listen to what God the LORD will say; he promises peace to his people, his saints- but let them not return to folly.</verse>
<verse>Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.</verse>
<verse>Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.</verse>
<verse>Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.</verse>
<verse>Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.</verse>
