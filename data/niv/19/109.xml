<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="109">
<verse>O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,</verse>
<verse>for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.</verse>
<verse>With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.</verse>
<verse>In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.</verse>
<verse>They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship.</verse>
<verse>Appoint an evil man to oppose him; let an accuser stand at his right hand.</verse>
<verse>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.</verse>
<verse>May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.</verse>
<verse>May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</verse>
<verse>May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.</verse>
<verse>May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</verse>
<verse>May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.</verse>
<verse>May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.</verse>
<verse>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.</verse>
<verse>May their sins always remain before the LORD, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</verse>
<verse>For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.</verse>
<verse>He loved to pronounce a curse- may it come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing- may it be far from him.</verse>
<verse>He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</verse>
<verse>May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.</verse>
<verse>May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.</verse>
<verse>But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</verse>
<verse>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</verse>
<verse>I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</verse>
<verse>My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</verse>
<verse>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.</verse>
<verse>Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.</verse>
<verse>Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.</verse>
<verse>They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.</verse>
<verse>My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.</verse>
<verse>With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.</verse>
<verse>For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him.</verse>
