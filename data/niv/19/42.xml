<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="42">
<verse>As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.</verse>
<verse>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?</verse>
<verse>My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.</verse>
<verse>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and</verse>
<verse>my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon-from Mount Mizar.</verse>
<verse>Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.</verse>
<verse>By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me- a prayer to the God of my life.</verse>
<verse>I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"</verse>
<verse>My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</verse>
