<verse>Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD from the heavens, praise him in the heights above.</verse>
<verse>Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his heavenly hosts.</verse>
<verse>Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars.</verse>
<verse>Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise the name of the LORD, for he commanded and they were created.</verse>
<verse>He set them in place for ever and ever; he gave a decree that will never pass away.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,</verse>
<verse>lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding,</verse>
<verse>you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,</verse>
<verse>wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds,</verse>
<verse>kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth,</verse>
<verse>young men and maidens, old men and children.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.</verse>
<verse>He has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his saints, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the LORD.</verse>
