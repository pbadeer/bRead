<verse>Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;</verse>
<verse>make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,</verse>
<verse>with trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn- shout for joy before the LORD, the King.</verse>
<verse>Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.</verse>
<verse>Let the rivers clap their hands, Let the mountains sing together for joy;</verse>
<verse>let them sing before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.</verse>
