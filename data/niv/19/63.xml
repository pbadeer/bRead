<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="63">
<verse>O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.</verse>
<verse>I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.</verse>
<verse>Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.</verse>
<verse>I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.</verse>
<verse>My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.</verse>
<verse>On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.</verse>
<verse>Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.</verse>
<verse>My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.</verse>
<verse>They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.</verse>
<verse>They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.</verse>
<verse>But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God's name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.</verse>
