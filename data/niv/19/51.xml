<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="51">
<verse>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.</verse>
<verse>Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.</verse>
<verse>For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.</verse>
<verse>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.</verse>
<verse>Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.</verse>
<verse>Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</verse>
<verse>Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</verse>
<verse>Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.</verse>
<verse>Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.</verse>
<verse>Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.</verse>
<verse>Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.</verse>
<verse>Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.</verse>
<verse>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</verse>
<verse>Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.</verse>
<verse>O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.</verse>
<verse>You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.</verse>
<verse>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</verse>
<verse>In your good pleasure make Zion prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</verse>
