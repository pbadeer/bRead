<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="60">
<verse>You have rejected us, O God, and burst forth upon us; you have been angry-now restore us!</verse>
<verse>You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.</verse>
<verse>You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.</verse>
<verse>But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Selah</verse>
<verse>Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.</verse>
<verse>God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.</verse>
<verse>Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?</verse>
<verse>Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.</verse>
<verse>With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.</verse>
