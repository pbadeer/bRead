<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="108">
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my soul.</verse>
<verse>Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.</verse>
<verse>I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.</verse>
<verse>For great is your love, higher than the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let your glory be over all the earth.</verse>
<verse>Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.</verse>
<verse>God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.</verse>
<verse>Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?</verse>
<verse>Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.</verse>
<verse>With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.</verse>
