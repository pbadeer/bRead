<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="30">
<verse>I will exalt you, O LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, you brought me up from the grave; you spared me from going down into the pit.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD, you saints of his; praise his holy name.</verse>
<verse>For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</verse>
<verse>When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken."</verse>
<verse>O LORD, when you favored me, you made my mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.</verse>
<verse>To you, O LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:</verse>
<verse>"What gain is there in my destruction, in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</verse>
<verse>Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me; O LORD, be my help."</verse>
<verse>You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,</verse>
<verse>that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever.</verse>
