<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="53">
<verse>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.</verse>
<verse>God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</verse>
<verse>Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Will the evildoers never learn- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?</verse>
<verse>There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</verse>
