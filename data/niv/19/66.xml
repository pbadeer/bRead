<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="66">
<verse>Shout with joy to God, all the earth!</verse>
<verse>Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious!</verse>
<verse>Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.</verse>
<verse>All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing praise to your name." Selah</verse>
<verse>Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works in man's behalf!</verse>
<verse>He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot- come, let us rejoice in him.</verse>
<verse>He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations- let not the rebellious rise up against him. Selah</verse>
<verse>Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;</verse>
<verse>he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.</verse>
<verse>For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver.</verse>
<verse>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.</verse>
<verse>You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.</verse>
<verse>I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you-</verse>
<verse>vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.</verse>
<verse>I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah</verse>
<verse>Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.</verse>
<verse>I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.</verse>
<verse>If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;</verse>
<verse>but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer.</verse>
<verse>Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!</verse>
