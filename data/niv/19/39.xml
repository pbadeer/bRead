<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="39">
<verse>I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."</verse>
<verse>But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.</verse>
<verse>My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:</verse>
<verse>"Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.</verse>
<verse>You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah</verse>
<verse>Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.</verse>
<verse>"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.</verse>
<verse>Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.</verse>
<verse>I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.</verse>
<verse>Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</verse>
<verse>You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth- each man is but a breath. Selah</verse>
<verse>"Hear my prayer, O LORD, listen to my cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien, a stranger, as all my fathers were.</verse>
<verse>Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more."</verse>
