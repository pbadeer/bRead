<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="2">
<verse>Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?</verse>
<verse>The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One.</verse>
<verse>"Let us break their chains," they say, "and throw off their fetters."</verse>
<verse>The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.</verse>
<verse>Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,</verse>
<verse>"I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill."</verse>
<verse>I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father.</verse>
<verse>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.</verse>
<verse>You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery."</verse>
<verse>Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.</verse>
<verse>Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
<verse>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</verse>
