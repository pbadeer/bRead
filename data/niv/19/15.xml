<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="15">
<verse>LORD, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?</verse>
<verse>He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart</verse>
<verse>and has no slander on his tongue, who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman,</verse>
<verse>who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his oath even when it hurts,</verse>
<verse>who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.</verse>
