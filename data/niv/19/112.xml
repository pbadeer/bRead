<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="112">
<verse>Praise the LORD. Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who finds great delight in his commands.</verse>
<verse>His children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.</verse>
<verse>Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.</verse>
<verse>Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for the gracious and compassionate and righteous man.</verse>
<verse>Good will come to him who is generous and lends freely, who conducts his affairs with justice.</verse>
<verse>Surely he will never be shaken; a righteous man will be remembered forever.</verse>
<verse>He will have no fear of bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>His heart is secure, he will have no fear; in the end he will look in triumph on his foes.</verse>
<verse>He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor, his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.</verse>
<verse>The wicked man will see and be vexed, he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.</verse>
