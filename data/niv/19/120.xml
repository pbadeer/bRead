<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="120">
<verse>I call on the LORD in my distress, and he answers me.</verse>
<verse>Save me, O LORD, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.</verse>
<verse>What will he do to you, and what more besides, O deceitful tongue?</verse>
<verse>He will punish you with a warrior's sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom tree.</verse>
<verse>Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!</verse>
<verse>Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.</verse>
<verse>I am a man of peace; but when I speak, they are for war.</verse>
