<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="96">
<verse>Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day.</verse>
<verse>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.</verse>
<verse>For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.</verse>
<verse>For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.</verse>
<verse>Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD, O families of nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts.</verse>
<verse>Worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth.</verse>
<verse>Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns." The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.</verse>
<verse>Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it;</verse>
<verse>let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy;</verse>
<verse>they will sing before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his truth.</verse>
