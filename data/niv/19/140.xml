<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="140">
<verse>Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; protect me from men of violence,</verse>
<verse>who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.</verse>
<verse>They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah</verse>
<verse>Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from men of violence who plan to trip my feet.</verse>
<verse>Proud men have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. Selah</verse>
<verse>O LORD, I say to you, "You are my God." Hear, O LORD, my cry for mercy.</verse>
<verse>O Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle-</verse>
<verse>do not grant the wicked their desires, O LORD; do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah</verse>
<verse>Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused.</verse>
<verse>Let burning coals fall upon them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.</verse>
<verse>Let slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down men of violence.</verse>
<verse>I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy.</verse>
<verse>Surely the righteous will praise your name and the upright will live before you.</verse>
