<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="125">
<verse>Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.</verse>
<verse>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people both now and forevermore.</verse>
<verse>The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil.</verse>
<verse>Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.</verse>
