<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="7">
<verse>O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,</verse>
<verse>or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands-</verse>
<verse>if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe-</verse>
<verse>then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Selah</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.</verse>
<verse>Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;</verse>
<verse>let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.</verse>
<verse>O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure.</verse>
<verse>My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.</verse>
<verse>If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.</verse>
<verse>He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.</verse>
<verse>He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.</verse>
<verse>He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.</verse>
<verse>The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head.</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</verse>
