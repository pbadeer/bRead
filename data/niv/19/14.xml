<chapter translation="NIV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="14">
<verse>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.</verse>
<verse>The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</verse>
<verse>All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Will evildoers never learn- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD?</verse>
<verse>There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</verse>
