<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Nahum" book-id="34" n="3">
<verse>Woe to the bloody city, all full of lies and plunder--no end to the prey!</verse>
<verse>The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!</verse>
<verse>Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end--they stumble over the bodies!</verse>
<verse>And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute, graceful and of deadly charms, who betrays nations with her whorings, and peoples with her charms.</verse>
<verse>Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame.</verse>
<verse>I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.</verse>
<verse>And all who look at you will shrink from you and say, Wasted is Nineveh; who will grieve for her? Where shall I seek comforters for you?</verse>
<verse>Are you better than Thebes that sat by the Nile, with water around her, her rampart a sea, and water her wall?</verse>
<verse>Cush was her strength; Egypt too, and that without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers.</verse>
<verse>Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity; her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; for her honored men lots were cast, and all her great men were bound in chains.</verse>
<verse>You also will be drunken; you will go into hiding; you will seek a refuge from the enemy.</verse>
<verse>All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs--if shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
<verse>Behold, your troops are women in your midst. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has devoured your bars.</verse>
<verse>Draw water for the siege; strengthen your forts; go into the clay; tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!</verse>
<verse>There will the fire devour you; the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!</verse>
<verse>You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust spreads its wings and flies away.</verse>
<verse>Your princes are like grasshoppers, your scribes like clouds of locusts settling on the fences in a day of cold--when the sun rises, they fly away; no one knows where they are.</verse>
<verse>Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with none to gather them.</verse>
<verse>There is no easing your hurt; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For upon whom has not come your unceasing evil?</verse>
