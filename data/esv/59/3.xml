<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="James" book-id="59" n="3">
<verse>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.</verse>
<verse>For we all stumble in many ways, and if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.</verse>
<verse>If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.</verse>
<verse>Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</verse>
<verse>So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!</verse>
<verse>And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.</verse>
<verse>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,</verse>
<verse>but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
<verse>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.</verse>
<verse>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
<verse>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?</verse>
<verse>Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</verse>
<verse>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.</verse>
<verse>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</verse>
<verse>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</verse>
<verse>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.</verse>
<verse>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.</verse>
<verse>And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
