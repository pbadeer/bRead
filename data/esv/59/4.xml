<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="James" book-id="59" n="4">
<verse>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?</verse>
<verse>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.</verse>
<verse>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.</verse>
<verse>You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
<verse>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"?</verse>
<verse>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
<verse>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
<verse>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
<verse>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.</verse>
<verse>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
<verse>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</verse>
<verse>There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</verse>
<verse>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"--</verse>
<verse>yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.</verse>
<verse>Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."</verse>
<verse>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
<verse>So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.</verse>
