<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="1 Peter" book_id="60" n="5">
<verse>So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:</verse>
<verse>shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;</verse>
<verse>not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.</verse>
<verse>And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
<verse>Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
<verse>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,</verse>
<verse>casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.</verse>
<verse>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</verse>
<verse>Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.</verse>
<verse>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.</verse>
<verse>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
<verse>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.</verse>
<verse>She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.</verse>
<verse>Greet one another with the kiss of love.Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</verse>
