<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Ephesians" book_id="49" n="3">
<verse>For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles--</verse>
<verse>assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you,</verse>
<verse>how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly.</verse>
<verse>When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,</verse>
<verse>which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.</verse>
<verse>This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
<verse>Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power.</verse>
<verse>To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</verse>
<verse>and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things,</verse>
<verse>so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.</verse>
<verse>This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
<verse>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.</verse>
<verse>So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.</verse>
<verse>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,</verse>
<verse>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
<verse>that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</verse>
<verse>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith--that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
<verse>may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
<verse>and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
<verse>Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,</verse>
<verse>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
