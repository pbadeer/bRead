<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="1 Timothy" book_id="54" n="4">
<verse>Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,</verse>
<verse>through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,</verse>
<verse>who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
<verse>For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</verse>
<verse>for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
<verse>If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed.</verse>
<verse>Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness;</verse>
<verse>for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.</verse>
<verse>The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.</verse>
<verse>For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.</verse>
<verse>Command and teach these things.</verse>
<verse>Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
<verse>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
<verse>Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.</verse>
<verse>Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress.</verse>
<verse>Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.</verse>
