<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="1 Timothy" book_id="54" n="2">
<verse>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,</verse>
<verse>for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.</verse>
<verse>This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
<verse>who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
<verse>For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.</verse>
<verse>For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
<verse>I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling;</verse>
<verse>likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,</verse>
<verse>but with what is proper for women who profess godliness--with good works.</verse>
<verse>Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.</verse>
<verse>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.</verse>
<verse>For Adam was formed first, then Eve;</verse>
<verse>and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.</verse>
<verse>Yet she will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.</verse>
