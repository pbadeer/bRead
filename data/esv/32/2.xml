<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Jonah" book-id="32" n="2">
<verse>Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,</verse>
<verse>saying, "I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.</verse>
<verse>For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.</verse>
<verse>Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; Yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.'</verse>
<verse>The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head</verse>
<verse>at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.</verse>
<verse>When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.</verse>
<verse>Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love.</verse>
<verse>But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the LORD!"</verse>
<verse>And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.</verse>
