<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Colossians" book_id="51" n="4">
<verse>Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
<verse>Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
<verse>At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison--</verse>
<verse>that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.</verse>
<verse>Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the best use of the time.</verse>
<verse>Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.</verse>
<verse>Tychicus will tell you all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</verse>
<verse>I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts,</verse>
<verse>and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.</verse>
<verse>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions--if he comes to you, welcome him),</verse>
<verse>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.</verse>
<verse>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
<verse>For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.</verse>
<verse>Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.</verse>
<verse>Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</verse>
<verse>And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
<verse>And say to Archippus, "See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord."</verse>
<verse>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</verse>
