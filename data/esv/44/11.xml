<verse>Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</verse>
<verse>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying,</verse>
<verse>"You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."</verse>
<verse>But Peter began and explained it to them in order:</verse>
<verse>"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.</verse>
<verse>Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.</verse>
<verse>And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'</verse>
<verse>But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'</verse>
<verse>But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'</verse>
<verse>This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
<verse>And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
<verse>And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.</verse>
<verse>And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;</verse>
<verse>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'</verse>
<verse>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.</verse>
<verse>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
<verse>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"</verse>
<verse>When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life."</verse>
<verse>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</verse>
<verse>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</verse>
<verse>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
<verse>The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</verse>
<verse>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,</verse>
<verse>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.</verse>
<verse>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,</verse>
<verse>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</verse>
<verse>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
<verse>And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).</verse>
<verse>So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.</verse>
<verse>And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
