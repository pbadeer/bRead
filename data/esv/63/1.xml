<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="2 John" book_id="63" n="1">
<verse>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,</verse>
<verse>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</verse>
<verse>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.</verse>
<verse>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.</verse>
<verse>And now I ask you, dear lady--not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning--that we love one another.</verse>
<verse>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</verse>
<verse>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
<verse>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.</verse>
<verse>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
<verse>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,</verse>
<verse>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</verse>
<verse>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
<verse>The children of your elect sister greet you.</verse>
