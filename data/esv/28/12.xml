<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book-id="28" n="12">
<verse>Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him according to his deeds.</verse>
<verse>In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he strove with God.</verse>
<verse>He strove with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought his favor. He met God at Bethel, and there God spoke with us--</verse>
<verse>the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name:</verse>
<verse>"So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God."</verse>
<verse>A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress.</verse>
<verse>Ephraim has said, "Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin."</verse>
<verse>I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.</verse>
<verse>I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables.</verse>
<verse>If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing: in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field.</verse>
<verse>Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep.</verse>
<verse>By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.</verse>
<verse>Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.</verse>
