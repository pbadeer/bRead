<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book_id="28" n="6">
<verse>"Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up.</verse>
<verse>After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him.</verse>
<verse>Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD; his going out is sure as the dawn; he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth."</verse>
<verse>What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light.</verse>
<verse>For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</verse>
<verse>But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood.</verse>
<verse>As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy.</verse>
<verse>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.</verse>
<verse>For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore the fortunes of my people.</verse>
