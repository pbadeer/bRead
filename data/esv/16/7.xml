<verse>Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,</verse>
<verse>I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many.</verse>
<verse>And I said to them, "Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot. And while they are still standing guard, let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, some at their guard posts and some in front of their own homes."</verse>
<verse>The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt.</verse>
<verse>Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:</verse>
<verse>These were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town.</verse>

<verse>the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642.</verse>
<verse>Also, of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).</verse>
<verse>These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.</verse>
<verse>The governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim should arise.</verse>
<verse>The whole assembly together was 42,360,</verse>
<verse>besides their male and female servants, of whom there were 7,337. And they had 245 singers, male and female.</verse>
<verse>Their horses were 736, their mules 245,</verse>
<verse>their camels 435, and their donkeys 6,720.</verse>
<verse>Now some of the heads of fathers' houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 basins, 30 priests' garments and 500 minas of silver.</verse>
<verse>And some of the heads of fathers' houses gave into the treasury of the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.</verse>
<verse>And what the rest of the people gave was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests' garments.</verse>
<verse>So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.And when the seventh month had come, the people of Israel were in their towns.</verse>
