<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="3">
<verse>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
<verse>And Job said:</verse>
<verse>"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'</verse>
<verse>Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.</verse>
<verse>Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
<verse>That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
<verse>Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.</verse>
<verse>Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.</verse>
<verse>Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,</verse>
<verse>because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
<verse>"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?</verse>
<verse>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</verse>
<verse>For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</verse>
<verse>with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,</verse>
<verse>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
<verse>Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?</verse>
<verse>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
<verse>There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
<verse>The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</verse>
<verse>"Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
<verse>who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</verse>
<verse>who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?</verse>
<verse>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
<verse>For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
<verse>For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.</verse>
<verse>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."</verse>
