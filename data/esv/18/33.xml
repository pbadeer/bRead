<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="33">
<verse>"But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.</verse>
<verse>Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.</verse>
<verse>My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.</verse>
<verse>The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</verse>
<verse>Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.</verse>
<verse>Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay.</verse>
<verse>Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you.</verse>
<verse>"Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words.</verse>
<verse>You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me.</verse>
<verse>Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy,</verse>
<verse>he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'</verse>
<verse>"Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.</verse>
<verse>Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?</verse>
<verse>For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it.</verse>
<verse>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,</verse>
<verse>then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,</verse>
<verse>that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;</verse>
<verse>he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
<verse>"Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones,</verse>
<verse>so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food.</verse>
<verse>His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.</verse>
<verse>His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death.</verse>
<verse>If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him,</verse>
<verse>and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom;</verse>
<verse>let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor';</verse>
<verse>then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.</verse>
<verse>He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me.</verse>
<verse>He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'</verse>
<verse>"Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,</verse>
<verse>to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life.</verse>
<verse>Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
<verse>If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.</verse>
<verse>If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</verse>
