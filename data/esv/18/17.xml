<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="17">
<verse>My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me.</verse>
<verse>Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation.</verse>
<verse>"Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there who will put up security for me?</verse>
<verse>Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph.</verse>
<verse>He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property--the eyes of his children will fail.</verse>
<verse>"He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit.</verse>
<verse>My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow.</verse>
<verse>The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless.</verse>
<verse>Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.</verse>
<verse>But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you.</verse>
<verse>My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart.</verse>
<verse>They make night into day; 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.'</verse>
<verse>If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness,</verse>
<verse>if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'</verse>
<verse>where then is my hope? Who will see my hope?</verse>
<verse>Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"</verse>
