<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="28">
<verse>"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine.</verse>
<verse>Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore.</verse>
<verse>Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.</verse>
<verse>He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro.</verse>
<verse>As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire.</verse>
<verse>Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.</verse>
<verse>"That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.</verse>
<verse>The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.</verse>
<verse>"Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots.</verse>
<verse>He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.</verse>
<verse>He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light.</verse>
<verse>"But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?</verse>
<verse>Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</verse>
<verse>It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price.</verse>
<verse>It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.</verse>
<verse>Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</verse>
<verse>No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.</verse>
<verse>The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.</verse>
<verse>"From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?</verse>
<verse>It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.</verse>
<verse>Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'</verse>
<verse>"God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.</verse>
<verse>For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</verse>
<verse>When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,</verse>
<verse>when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,</verse>
<verse>then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.</verse>
<verse>And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"</verse>
