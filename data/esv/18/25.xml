<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven.</verse>
<verse>Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?</verse>
<verse>How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure?</verse>
<verse>Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes;</verse>
<verse>how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"</verse>
