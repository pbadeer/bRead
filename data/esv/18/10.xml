<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="10">
<verse>"I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
<verse>I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me.</verse>
<verse>Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked?</verse>
<verse>Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees?</verse>
<verse>Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years,</verse>
<verse>that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,</verse>
<verse>although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand?</verse>
<verse>Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether.</verse>
<verse>Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?</verse>
<verse>Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?</verse>
<verse>You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.</verse>
<verse>You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.</verse>
<verse>Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.</verse>
<verse>If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity.</verse>
<verse>If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction.</verse>
<verse>And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me.</verse>
<verse>You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.</verse>
<verse>"Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me</verse>
<verse>and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
<verse>Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer</verse>
<verse>before I go--and I shall not return--to the land of darkness and deep shadow,</verse>
<verse>the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness."</verse>
