<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="22">
<verse>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</verse>
<verse>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?</verse>
<verse>Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you?</verse>
<verse>Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities.</verse>
<verse>For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
<verse>You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</verse>
<verse>The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it.</verse>
<verse>You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed.</verse>
<verse>Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,</verse>
<verse>or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.</verse>
<verse>"Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!</verse>
<verse>But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?</verse>
<verse>Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.'</verse>
<verse>Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod?</verse>
<verse>They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away.</verse>
<verse>They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'</verse>
<verse>Yet he filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
<verse>The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them,</verse>
<verse>saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.'</verse>
<verse>"Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you.</verse>
<verse>Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.</verse>
<verse>If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,</verse>
<verse>if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed,</verse>
<verse>then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.</verse>
<verse>For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.</verse>
<verse>You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.</verse>
<verse>You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.</verse>
<verse>For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly.</verse>
<verse>He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</verse>
