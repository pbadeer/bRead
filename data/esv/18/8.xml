<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?</verse>
<verse>Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?</verse>
<verse>If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</verse>
<verse>If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,</verse>
<verse>if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.</verse>
<verse>And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.</verse>
<verse>"For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out.</verse>
<verse>For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow.</verse>
<verse>Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?</verse>
<verse>"Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?</verse>
<verse>While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.</verse>
<verse>Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.</verse>
<verse>His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web.</verse>
<verse>He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.</verse>
<verse>He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden.</verse>
<verse>His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.</verse>
<verse>If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'</verse>
<verse>Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers.</verse>
<verse>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting.</verse>
<verse>Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."</verse>
