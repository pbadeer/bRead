<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak.</verse>
<verse>Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?</verse>
<verse>You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place?</verse>
<verse>"Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine.</verse>
<verse>The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out.</verse>
<verse>His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down.</verse>
<verse>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh.</verse>
<verse>A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him.</verse>
<verse>A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path.</verse>
<verse>Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels.</verse>
<verse>His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling.</verse>
<verse>It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.</verse>
<verse>He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors.</verse>
<verse>In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation.</verse>
<verse>His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above.</verse>
<verse>His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street.</verse>
<verse>He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world.</verse>
<verse>He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live.</verse>
<verse>They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east.</verse>
<verse>Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God."</verse>
