<verse>Then Job answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!</verse>
<verse>I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
<verse>I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.</verse>
<verse>Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me.</verse>
<verse>There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him;</verse>
<verse>on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.</verse>
<verse>But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold.</verse>
<verse>My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.</verse>
<verse>I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.</verse>
<verse>But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does.</verse>
<verse>For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.</verse>
<verse>God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;</verse>
<verse>yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.</verse>
