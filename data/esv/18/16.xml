<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="16">
<verse>Then Job answered and said:</verse>
<verse>"I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.</verse>
<verse>Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?</verse>
<verse>I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you.</verse>
<verse>I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.</verse>
<verse>"If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?</verse>
<verse>Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.</verse>
<verse>And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face.</verse>
<verse>He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.</verse>
<verse>Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me.</verse>
<verse>God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;</verse>
<verse>his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.</verse>
<verse>He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior.</verse>
<verse>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust.</verse>
<verse>My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness,</verse>
<verse>although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.</verse>
<verse>"O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place.</verse>
<verse>Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high.</verse>
<verse>My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,</verse>
<verse>that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor.</verse>
<verse>For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return.</verse>
