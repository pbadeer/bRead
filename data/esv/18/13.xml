<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="13">
<verse>"Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.</verse>
<verse>What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.</verse>
<verse>But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God.</verse>
<verse>As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all.</verse>
<verse>Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom!</verse>
<verse>Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
<verse>Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him?</verse>
<verse>Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God?</verse>
<verse>Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man?</verse>
<verse>He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality.</verse>
<verse>Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you?</verse>
<verse>Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.</verse>
<verse>"Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may.</verse>
<verse>Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand?</verse>
<verse>Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face.</verse>
<verse>This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him.</verse>
<verse>Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears.</verse>
<verse>Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right.</verse>
<verse>Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.</verse>
<verse>Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face:</verse>
<verse>withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me.</verse>
<verse>Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me.</verse>
<verse>How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
<verse>Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy?</verse>
<verse>Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff?</verse>
<verse>For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.</verse>
<verse>You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet.</verse>
<verse>Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.</verse>
