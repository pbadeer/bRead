<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book_id="26" n="15">
<verse>And the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
<verse>Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?</verse>
<verse>Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?</verse>
<verse>Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!</verse>
<verse>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.</verse>
<verse>And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD."</verse>
