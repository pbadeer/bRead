<verse>But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.</verse>
<verse>Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.</verse>
<verse>Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,</verse>
<verse>and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,</verse>
<verse>to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled.</verse>
<verse>Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.</verse>
<verse>Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity,</verse>
<verse>and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.</verse>
<verse>Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,</verse>
<verse>not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.</verse>
<verse>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,</verse>
<verse>training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,</verse>
<verse>waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.</verse>
<verse>Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.</verse>
