<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Titus" book_id="56" n="1">
<verse>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness,</verse>
<verse>in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began</verse>
<verse>and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;</verse>
<verse>To Titus, my true child in a common faith:Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
<verse>This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you--</verse>
<verse>if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination.</verse>
<verse>For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain,</verse>
<verse>but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.</verse>
<verse>He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.</verse>
<verse>For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party.</verse>
<verse>They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.</verse>
<verse>One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."</verse>
<verse>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
<verse>not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth.</verse>
<verse>To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.</verse>
<verse>They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.</verse>
