<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Luke" book_id="42" n="24">
<verse>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.</verse>
<verse>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
<verse>but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
<verse>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</verse>
<verse>And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
<verse>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
<verse>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise."</verse>
<verse>And they remembered his words,</verse>
<verse>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
<verse>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,</verse>
<verse>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.</verse>
<verse>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</verse>
<verse>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,</verse>
<verse>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</verse>
<verse>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
<verse>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
<verse>And he said to them, "What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
<verse>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</verse>
<verse>And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
<verse>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
<verse>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</verse>
<verse>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</verse>
<verse>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
<verse>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</verse>
<verse>And he said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
<verse>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</verse>
<verse>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
<verse>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther,</verse>
<verse>but they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
<verse>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.</verse>
<verse>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight.</verse>
<verse>They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"</verse>
<verse>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
<verse>saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
<verse>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
<verse>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace to you!"</verse>
<verse>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
<verse>And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
<verse>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."</verse>
<verse>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
<verse>And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
<verse>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
<verse>and he took it and ate before them.</verse>
<verse>Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."</verse>
<verse>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
<verse>and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</verse>
<verse>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
<verse>And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
<verse>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.</verse>
<verse>While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
<verse>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
<verse>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</verse>
