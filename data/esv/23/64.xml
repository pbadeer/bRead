<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="64">
<verse>Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence--</verse>
<verse>as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil--to make your name known to your adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at your presence!</verse>
<verse>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.</verse>
<verse>From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.</verse>
<verse>You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?</verse>
<verse>We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</verse>
<verse>There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.</verse>
<verse>But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.</verse>
<verse>Be not so terribly angry, O LORD, and remember not iniquity forever. Behold, please look, we are all your people.</verse>
<verse>Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
<verse>Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.</verse>
<verse>Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?</verse>
