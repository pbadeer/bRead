<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="6">
<verse>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.</verse>
<verse>Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
<verse>And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!"</verse>
<verse>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
<verse>And I said: "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"</verse>
<verse>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.</verse>
<verse>And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.</verse>
<verse>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me."</verse>
<verse>And he said, "Go, and say to this people: "'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'</verse>
<verse>Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."</verse>
<verse>Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste,</verse>
<verse>and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</verse>
<verse>And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.</verse>
