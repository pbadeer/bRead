<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="1">
<verse>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
<verse>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: "Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.</verse>
<verse>The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."</verse>
<verse>Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.</verse>
<verse>Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
<verse>From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil.</verse>
<verse>Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.</verse>
<verse>And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</verse>
<verse>If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.</verse>
<verse>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</verse>
<verse>"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.</verse>
<verse>"When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts?</verse>
<verse>Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations--I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.</verse>
<verse>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
<verse>When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
<verse>Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,</verse>
<verse>learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.</verse>
<verse>"Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</verse>
<verse>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
<verse>but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."</verse>
<verse>How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
<verse>Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water.</verse>
<verse>Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the Lord declares, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will get relief from my enemies and avenge myself on my foes.</verse>
<verse>I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.</verse>
<verse>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."</verse>
<verse>Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.</verse>
<verse>But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
<verse>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
<verse>For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.</verse>
<verse>And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.</verse>
