<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="50">
<verse>Thus says the LORD: "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce, with which I sent her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.</verse>
<verse>Why, when I came, was there no man; why, when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.</verse>
<verse>I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering."</verse>
<verse>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary. Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</verse>
<verse>The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious; I turned not backward.</verse>
<verse>I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.</verse>
<verse>But the Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</verse>
<verse>He who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</verse>
<verse>Behold, the Lord GOD helps me; who will declare me guilty? Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.</verse>
<verse>Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.</verse>
<verse>Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who equip yourselves with burning torches! Walk by the light of your fire, and by the torches that you have kindled! This you have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment.</verse>
