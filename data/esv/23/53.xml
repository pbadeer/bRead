<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="53">
<verse>Who has believed what they heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</verse>
<verse>For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.</verse>
<verse>He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</verse>
<verse>Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.</verse>
<verse>But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed.</verse>
<verse>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</verse>
<verse>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.</verse>
<verse>By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?</verse>
<verse>And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.</verse>
<verse>Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</verse>
<verse>Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.</verse>
