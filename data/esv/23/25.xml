<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="25">
<verse>O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and sure.</verse>
<verse>For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; the foreigners' palace is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.</verse>
<verse>Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; cities of ruthless nations will fear you.</verse>
<verse>For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat; for the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall,</verse>
<verse>like heat in a dry place. You subdue the noise of the foreigners; as heat by the shade of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is put down.</verse>
<verse>On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined.</verse>
<verse>And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations.</verse>
<verse>He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.</verse>
<verse>It will be said on that day, "Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the LORD; we have waited for him; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation."</verse>
<verse>For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled down in his place, as straw is trampled down in a dunghill.</verse>
<verse>And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim, but the LORD will lay low his pompous pride together with the skill of his hands.</verse>
<verse>And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust.</verse>
