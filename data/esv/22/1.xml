<verse>The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.</verse>
<verse>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine;</verse>
<verse>your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you.</verse>
<verse>Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.</verse>
<verse>I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
<verse>Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!</verse>
<verse>Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?</verse>
<verse>If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>
<verse>I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.</verse>
<verse>Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.</verse>
<verse>We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver.</verse>
<verse>While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance.</verse>
<verse>My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts.</verse>
<verse>My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi.</verse>
<verse>Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.</verse>
<verse>Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green;</verse>
<verse>the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.</verse>
