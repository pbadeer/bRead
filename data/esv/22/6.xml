<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Song of Solomon" book-id="22" n="6">
<verse>Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?</verse>
<verse>My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies.</verse>
<verse>I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.</verse>
<verse>You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.</verse>
<verse>Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me--Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead.</verse>
<verse>Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young.</verse>
<verse>Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.</verse>
<verse>There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.</verse>
<verse>My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.</verse>
<verse>"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?"</verse>
<verse>I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.</verse>
<verse>Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince.</verse>
<verse>Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you.Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?</verse>
