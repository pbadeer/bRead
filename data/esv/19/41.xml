<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="41">
<verse>Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him;</verse>
<verse>the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.</verse>
<verse>The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!"</verse>
<verse>My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die and his name perish?"</verse>
<verse>And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.</verse>
<verse>All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.</verse>
<verse>They say, "A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies."</verse>
<verse>Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them!</verse>
<verse>By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.</verse>
<verse>But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.</verse>
