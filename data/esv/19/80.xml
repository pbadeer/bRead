<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="80">
<verse>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.</verse>
<verse>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!</verse>
<verse>O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?</verse>
<verse>You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure.</verse>
<verse>You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved!</verse>
<verse>You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.</verse>
<verse>You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.</verse>
<verse>The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.</verse>
<verse>It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.</verse>
<verse>Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?</verse>
<verse>The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.</verse>
<verse>Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,</verse>
<verse>the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.</verse>
<verse>They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!</verse>
<verse>But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!</verse>
<verse>Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name!</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! let your face shine, that we may be saved!</verse>
