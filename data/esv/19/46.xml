<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="46">
<verse>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</verse>
<verse>Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,</verse>
<verse>though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah</verse>
<verse>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.</verse>
<verse>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.</verse>
<verse>The nations rage, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts.</verse>
<verse>The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah</verse>
<verse>Come, behold the works of the LORD, how he has brought desolations on the earth.</verse>
<verse>He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots with fire.</verse>
<verse>"Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!"</verse>
<verse>The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah</verse>
