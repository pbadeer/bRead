<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="121">
<verse>I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come?</verse>
<verse>My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth.</verse>
<verse>He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber.</verse>
<verse>Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand.</verse>
<verse>The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.</verse>
