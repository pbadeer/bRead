<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="23">
<verse>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</verse>
<verse>He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.</verse>
<verse>He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</verse>
<verse>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</verse>
<verse>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.</verse>
<verse>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</verse>
