<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="87">
<verse>On the holy mount stands the city he founded;</verse>
<verse>the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah</verse>
<verse>Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush--"This one was born there," they say.</verse>
<verse>And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her.</verse>
<verse>The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah</verse>
<verse>Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you."</verse>
