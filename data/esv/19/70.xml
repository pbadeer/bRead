<verse>Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!</verse>
<verse>Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!</verse>
<verse>Let them turn back because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!"</verse>
<verse>May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!"</verse>
<verse>But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!</verse>
