<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="120">
<verse>In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.</verse>
<verse>What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?</verse>
<verse>A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree!</verse>
<verse>Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!</verse>
<verse>Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace.</verse>
<verse>I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war!</verse>
