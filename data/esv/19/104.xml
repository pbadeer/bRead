<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="104">
<verse>Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty,</verse>
<verse>covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent.</verse>
<verse>He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind;</verse>
<verse>he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire.</verse>
<verse>He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.</verse>
<verse>You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</verse>
<verse>At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight.</verse>
<verse>The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them.</verse>
<verse>You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.</verse>
<verse>You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills;</verse>
<verse>they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</verse>
<verse>Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches.</verse>
<verse>From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.</verse>
<verse>You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth</verse>
<verse>and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man's heart.</verse>
<verse>The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</verse>
<verse>In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees.</verse>
<verse>The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.</verse>
<verse>He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.</verse>
<verse>You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about.</verse>
<verse>The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.</verse>
<verse>When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens.</verse>
<verse>Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</verse>
<verse>Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great.</verse>
<verse>There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.</verse>
<verse>These all look to you, to give them their food in due season.</verse>
<verse>When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.</verse>
<verse>When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.</verse>
<verse>When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.</verse>
<verse>May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works,</verse>
<verse>who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke!</verse>
<verse>I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.</verse>
<verse>May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!</verse>
