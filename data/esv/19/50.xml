<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="50">
<verse>The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.</verse>
<verse>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.</verse>
<verse>Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest.</verse>
<verse>He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:</verse>
<verse>"Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"</verse>
<verse>The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah</verse>
<verse>"Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.</verse>
<verse>Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.</verse>
<verse>I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds.</verse>
<verse>For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.</verse>
<verse>I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine.</verse>
<verse>"If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.</verse>
<verse>Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</verse>
<verse>Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High,</verse>
<verse>and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."</verse>
<verse>But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips?</verse>
<verse>For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.</verse>
<verse>If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.</verse>
<verse>"You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.</verse>
<verse>You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.</verse>
<verse>These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.</verse>
<verse>"Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver!</verse>
<verse>The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!"</verse>
