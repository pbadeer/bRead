<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="85">
<verse>LORD, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>You forgave the iniquity of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah</verse>
<verse>You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your hot anger.</verse>
<verse>Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us!</verse>
<verse>Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger to all generations?</verse>
<verse>Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?</verse>
<verse>Show us your steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly.</verse>
<verse>Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.</verse>
<verse>Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other.</verse>
<verse>Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from the sky.</verse>
<verse>Yes, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase.</verse>
<verse>Righteousness will go before him and make his footsteps a way.</verse>
