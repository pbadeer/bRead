<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="76">
<verse>In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.</verse>
<verse>His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.</verse>
<verse>There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah</verse>
<verse>Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains of prey.</verse>
<verse>The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands.</verse>
<verse>At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned.</verse>
<verse>But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused?</verse>
<verse>From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still,</verse>
<verse>when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah</verse>
<verse>Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt.</verse>
<verse>Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,</verse>
<verse>who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.</verse>
