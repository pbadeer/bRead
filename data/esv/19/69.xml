<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="69">
<verse>Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck.</verse>
<verse>I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.</verse>
<verse>I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.</verse>
<verse>More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore?</verse>
<verse>O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.</verse>
<verse>Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.</verse>
<verse>For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that dishonor has covered my face.</verse>
<verse>I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons.</verse>
<verse>For zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.</verse>
<verse>When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.</verse>
<verse>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.</verse>
<verse>I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.</verse>
<verse>Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.</verse>
<verse>Answer me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.</verse>
<verse>Hide not your face from your servant; for I am in distress; make haste to answer me.</verse>
<verse>Draw near to my soul, redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies!</verse>
<verse>You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to you.</verse>
<verse>Reproaches have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none.</verse>
<verse>They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.</verse>
<verse>Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace, let it become a trap.</verse>
<verse>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.</verse>
<verse>Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.</verse>
<verse>May their camp be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents.</verse>
<verse>For they persecute him whom you have struck down, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.</verse>
<verse>Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you.</verse>
<verse>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.</verse>
<verse>But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high!</verse>
<verse>I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.</verse>
<verse>This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.</verse>
<verse>When the humble see it they will be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.</verse>
<verse>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.</verse>
<verse>For God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah, and people shall dwell there and possess it;</verse>
<verse>the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it.</verse>
