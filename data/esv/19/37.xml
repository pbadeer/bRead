<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="37">
<verse>Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers!</verse>
<verse>For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb.</verse>
<verse>Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.</verse>
<verse>Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.</verse>
<verse>He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday.</verse>
<verse>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!</verse>
<verse>Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.</verse>
<verse>For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land.</verse>
<verse>In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.</verse>
<verse>But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.</verse>
<verse>The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him,</verse>
<verse>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.</verse>
<verse>The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright;</verse>
<verse>their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</verse>
<verse>Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.</verse>
<verse>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.</verse>
<verse>The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever;</verse>
<verse>they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance.</verse>
<verse>But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish--like smoke they vanish away.</verse>
<verse>The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;</verse>
<verse>for those blessed by the LORD shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.</verse>
<verse>The steps of a man are established by the LORD, when he delights in his way;</verse>
<verse>though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD upholds his hand.</verse>
<verse>I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.</verse>
<verse>He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing.</verse>
<verse>Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</verse>
<verse>The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever.</verse>
<verse>The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.</verse>
<verse>The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.</verse>
<verse>The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will not abandon him to his power or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.</verse>
<verse>Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off.</verse>
<verse>I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree.</verse>
<verse>But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.</verse>
<verse>Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.</verse>
<verse>But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.</verse>
<verse>The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</verse>
<verse>The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.</verse>
