<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="12">
<verse>Save, O LORD, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.</verse>
<verse>Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,</verse>
<verse>those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?"</verse>
<verse>"Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs."</verse>
<verse>The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.</verse>
<verse>You, O LORD, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.</verse>
<verse>On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.</verse>
