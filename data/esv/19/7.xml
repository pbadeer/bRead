<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="7">
<verse>O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,</verse>
<verse>lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,</verse>
<verse>if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,</verse>
<verse>let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.</verse>
<verse>Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high.</verse>
<verse>The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.</verse>
<verse>Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous--you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!</verse>
<verse>My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day.</verse>
<verse>If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;</verse>
<verse>he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.</verse>
<verse>Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.</verse>
<verse>He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.</verse>
<verse>His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.</verse>
<verse>I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.</verse>
