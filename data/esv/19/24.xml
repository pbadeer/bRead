<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="24">
<verse>The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein,</verse>
<verse>for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.</verse>
<verse>Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place?</verse>
<verse>He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully.</verse>
<verse>He will receive blessing from the LORD and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</verse>
<verse>Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</verse>
<verse>Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle!</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</verse>
<verse>Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah</verse>
