<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="130">
<verse>Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD!</verse>
<verse>O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy!</verse>
<verse>If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?</verse>
<verse>But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.</verse>
<verse>I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;</verse>
<verse>my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption.</verse>
<verse>And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</verse>
