<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="125">
<verse>Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.</verse>
<verse>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore.</verse>
<verse>For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wrong.</verse>
<verse>Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts!</verse>
<verse>But those who turn aside to their crooked ways the LORD will lead away with evildoers! Peace be upon Israel!</verse>
