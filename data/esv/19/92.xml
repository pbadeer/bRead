<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="92">
<verse>It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;</verse>
<verse>to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,</verse>
<verse>to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.</verse>
<verse>For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</verse>
<verse>How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!</verse>
<verse>The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:</verse>
<verse>that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;</verse>
<verse>but you, O LORD, are on high forever.</verse>
<verse>For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.</verse>
<verse>But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.</verse>
<verse>My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.</verse>
<verse>The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</verse>
<verse>They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.</verse>
<verse>They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,</verse>
<verse>to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
