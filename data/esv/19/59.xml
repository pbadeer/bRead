<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="59">
<verse>Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me;</verse>
<verse>deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men.</verse>
<verse>For behold, they lie in wait for my life; fierce men stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD,</verse>
<verse>for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake, come to meet me, and see!</verse>
<verse>You, LORD God of hosts, are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah</verse>
<verse>Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.</verse>
<verse>There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips--for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision.</verse>
<verse>O my Strength, I will watch for you, for you, O God, are my fortress.</verse>
<verse>My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.</verse>
<verse>Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord, our shield!</verse>
<verse>For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,</verse>
<verse>consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah</verse>
<verse>Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.</verse>
<verse>They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill.</verse>
<verse>But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.</verse>
<verse>O my Strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.</verse>
