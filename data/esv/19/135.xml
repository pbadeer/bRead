<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="135">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD, give praise, O servants of the LORD,</verse>
<verse>who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God!</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing to his name, for it is pleasant!</verse>
<verse>For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession.</verse>
<verse>For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</verse>
<verse>Whatever the LORD pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.</verse>
<verse>He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.</verse>
<verse>He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and of beast;</verse>
<verse>who in your midst, O Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants;</verse>
<verse>who struck down many nations and killed mighty kings,</verse>
<verse>Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,</verse>
<verse>and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.</verse>
<verse>Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, throughout all ages.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.</verse>
<verse>The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.</verse>
<verse>They have mouths, but do not speak; they have eyes, but do not see;</verse>
<verse>they have ears, but do not hear, nor is there any breath in their mouths.</verse>
<verse>Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them!</verse>
<verse>O house of Israel, bless the LORD! O house of Aaron, bless the LORD!</verse>
<verse>O house of Levi, bless the LORD! You who fear the LORD, bless the LORD!</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD from Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise the LORD!</verse>
