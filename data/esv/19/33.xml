<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="33">
<verse>Shout for joy in the LORD, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright.</verse>
<verse>Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; make melody to him with the harp of ten strings!</verse>
<verse>Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts.</verse>
<verse>For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host.</verse>
<verse>He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the deeps in storehouses.</verse>
<verse>Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!</verse>
<verse>For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</verse>
<verse>The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples.</verse>
<verse>The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!</verse>
<verse>The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man;</verse>
<verse>from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,</verse>
<verse>he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds.</verse>
<verse>The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.</verse>
<verse>The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue.</verse>
<verse>Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love,</verse>
<verse>that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine.</verse>
<verse>Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield.</verse>
<verse>For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name.</verse>
<verse>Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you.</verse>
