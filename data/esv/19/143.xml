<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="143">
<verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my pleas for mercy! In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness!</verse>
<verse>Enter not into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you.</verse>
<verse>For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.</verse>
<verse>Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled.</verse>
<verse>I remember the days of old; I meditate on all that you have done; I ponder the work of your hands.</verse>
<verse>I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah</verse>
<verse>Answer me quickly, O LORD! My spirit fails! Hide not your face from me, lest I be like those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust. Make me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD! I have fled to you for refuge!</verse>
<verse>Teach me to do your will, for you are my God! Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground!</verse>
<verse>For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life! In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble!</verse>
<verse>And in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies, and you will destroy all the adversaries of my soul, for I am your servant.</verse>
