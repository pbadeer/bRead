<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="88">
<verse>O LORD, God of my salvation; I cry out day and night before you.</verse>
<verse>Let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry!</verse>
<verse>For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.</verse>
<verse>I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am a man who has no strength,</verse>
<verse>like one set loose among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.</verse>
<verse>You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep.</verse>
<verse>Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah</verse>
<verse>You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;</verse>
<verse>my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you.</verse>
<verse>Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah</verse>
<verse>Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?</verse>
<verse>Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</verse>
<verse>But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, why do you cast my soul away? Why do you hide your face from me?</verse>
<verse>Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am helpless.</verse>
<verse>Your wrath has swept over me; your dreadful assaults destroy me.</verse>
<verse>They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in on me together.</verse>
<verse>You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me; my companions have become darkness.</verse>
