<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="102">
<verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you!</verse>
<verse>Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!</verse>
<verse>For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.</verse>
<verse>My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread.</verse>
<verse>Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh.</verse>
<verse>I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;</verse>
<verse>I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.</verse>
<verse>All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.</verse>
<verse>For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink,</verse>
<verse>because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down.</verse>
<verse>My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations.</verse>
<verse>You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.</verse>
<verse>For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust.</verse>
<verse>Nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory;</verse>
<verse>he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.</verse>
<verse>Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD:</verse>
<verse>that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,</verse>
<verse>to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die,</verse>
<verse>that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise,</verse>
<verse>when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD.</verse>
<verse>He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.</verse>
<verse>"O my God," I say, "take me not away in the midst of my days--you whose years endure throughout all generations!"</verse>
<verse>Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
<verse>They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,</verse>
<verse>but you are the same, and your years have no end.</verse>
<verse>The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.</verse>
