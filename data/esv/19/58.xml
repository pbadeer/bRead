<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="58">
<verse>Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?</verse>
<verse>No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.</verse>
<verse>The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.</verse>
<verse>They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,</verse>
<verse>so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.</verse>
<verse>O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!</verse>
<verse>Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.</verse>
<verse>Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.</verse>
<verse>Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!</verse>
<verse>The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Mankind will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."</verse>
