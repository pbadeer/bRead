<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="91">
<verse>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.</verse>
<verse>I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."</verse>
<verse>For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.</verse>
<verse>He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.</verse>
<verse>You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</verse>
<verse>nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.</verse>
<verse>A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</verse>
<verse>You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place--the Most High, who is my refuge--</verse>
<verse>no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent.</verse>
<verse>For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.</verse>
<verse>On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.</verse>
<verse>You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.</verse>
<verse>"Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.</verse>
<verse>When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.</verse>
<verse>With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."</verse>
