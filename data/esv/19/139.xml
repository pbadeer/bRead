<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="139">
<verse>O LORD, you have searched me and known me!</verse>
<verse>You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar.</verse>
<verse>You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways.</verse>
<verse>Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.</verse>
<verse>You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.</verse>
<verse>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain it.</verse>
<verse>Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence?</verse>
<verse>If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!</verse>
<verse>If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</verse>
<verse>even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.</verse>
<verse>If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night,"</verse>
<verse>even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you.</verse>
<verse>For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb.</verse>
<verse>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.</verse>
<verse>My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.</verse>
<verse>Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there were none of them.</verse>
<verse>How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!</verse>
<verse>If I would count them, they are more than the sand. I awake, and I am still with you.</verse>
<verse>Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God! O men of blood, depart from me!</verse>
<verse>They speak against you with malicious intent; your enemies take your name in vain!</verse>
<verse>Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?</verse>
<verse>I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies.</verse>
<verse>Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts!</verse>
<verse>And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!</verse>
