<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="17">
<verse>Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!</verse>
<verse>From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right!</verse>
<verse>You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.</verse>
<verse>With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.</verse>
<verse>My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</verse>
<verse>I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words.</verse>
<verse>Wondrously show your steadfast love, O Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.</verse>
<verse>Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,</verse>
<verse>from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies who surround me.</verse>
<verse>They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.</verse>
<verse>They have now surrounded our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.</verse>
<verse>He is like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him! Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</verse>
<verse>from men by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.</verse>
