<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="115">
<verse>Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!</verse>
<verse>Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"</verse>
<verse>Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases.</verse>
<verse>Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.</verse>
<verse>They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.</verse>
<verse>They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.</verse>
<verse>They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat.</verse>
<verse>Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron;</verse>
<verse>he will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD give you increase, you and your children!</verse>
<verse>May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth!</verse>
<verse>The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man.</verse>
<verse>The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.</verse>
<verse>But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!</verse>
