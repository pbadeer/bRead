<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="8">
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.</verse>
<verse>Out of the mouth of babes and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.</verse>
<verse>When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</verse>
<verse>what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?</verse>
<verse>Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.</verse>
<verse>You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,</verse>
<verse>all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,</verse>
<verse>the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</verse>
