<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="19">
<verse>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.</verse>
<verse>Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.</verse>
<verse>There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard.</verse>
<verse>Their measuring line goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,</verse>
<verse>which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.</verse>
<verse>Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat.</verse>
<verse>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;</verse>
<verse>the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes;</verse>
<verse>the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.</verse>
<verse>More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.</verse>
<verse>Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</verse>
<verse>Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.</verse>
<verse>Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.</verse>
<verse>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.</verse>
