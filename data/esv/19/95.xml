<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="95">
<verse>Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!</verse>
<verse>Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!</verse>
<verse>For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</verse>
<verse>In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.</verse>
<verse>The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</verse>
<verse>Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!</verse>
<verse>For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
<verse>do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,</verse>
<verse>when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.</verse>
<verse>For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways."</verse>
<verse>Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They shall not enter my rest."</verse>
