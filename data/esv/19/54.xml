<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="54">
<verse>O God, save me, by your name, and vindicate me by your might.</verse>
<verse>O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.</verse>
<verse>For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah</verse>
<verse>Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.</verse>
<verse>He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.</verse>
<verse>With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good.</verse>
<verse>For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.</verse>
