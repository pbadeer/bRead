<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="68">
<verse>God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered; and those who hate him shall flee before him!</verse>
<verse>As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away; as wax melts before fire, so the wicked shall perish before God!</verse>
<verse>But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy!</verse>
<verse>Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts; his name is the LORD; exult before him!</verse>
<verse>Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.</verse>
<verse>God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.</verse>
<verse>O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah</verse>
<verse>the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.</verse>
<verse>Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished;</verse>
<verse>your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.</verse>
<verse>The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host:</verse>
<verse>"The kings of the armies--they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil--</verse>
<verse>though you men lie among the sheepfolds--the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold.</verse>
<verse>When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon.</verse>
<verse>O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!</verse>
<verse>Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, yes, where the LORD will dwell forever?</verse>
<verse>The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah</verse>
<verse>Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.</verse>
<verse>But God will strike the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.</verse>
<verse>The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,</verse>
<verse>that you may strike your feet in their blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe."</verse>
<verse>Your procession is seen, O God, the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary--</verse>
<verse>the singers in front, the musicians last, between them virgins playing tambourines:</verse>
<verse>"Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"</verse>
<verse>There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.</verse>
<verse>Summon your power, O God, the power, O God, by which you have worked for us.</verse>
<verse>Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bear gifts to you.</verse>
<verse>Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.</verse>
<verse>Nobles shall come from Egypt; Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God.</verse>
<verse>O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, Selah</verse>
<verse>to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies.</verse>
<verse>Awesome is God from his sanctuary; the God of Israel--he is the one who gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!</verse>
