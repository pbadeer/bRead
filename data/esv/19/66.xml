<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="66">
<verse>Shout for joy to God, all the earth;</verse>
<verse>sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise!</verse>
<verse>Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.</verse>
<verse>All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name." Selah</verse>
<verse>Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.</verse>
<verse>He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,</verse>
<verse>who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations--let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah</verse>
<verse>Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard,</verse>
<verse>who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip.</verse>
<verse>For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried.</verse>
<verse>You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs;</verse>
<verse>you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.</verse>
<verse>I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you,</verse>
<verse>that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.</verse>
<verse>I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah</verse>
<verse>Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul.</verse>
<verse>I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.</verse>
<verse>If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.</verse>
<verse>But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!</verse>
