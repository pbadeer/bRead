<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="116">
<verse>I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy.</verse>
<verse>Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.</verse>
<verse>The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.</verse>
<verse>Then I called on the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!"</verse>
<verse>Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful.</verse>
<verse>The LORD preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me.</verse>
<verse>Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.</verse>
<verse>For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling;</verse>
<verse>I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>I believed, even when I spoke, "I am greatly afflicted";</verse>
<verse>I said in my alarm, "All mankind are liars."</verse>
<verse>What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits to me?</verse>
<verse>I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD,</verse>
<verse>I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.</verse>
<verse>Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.</verse>
<verse>I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people,</verse>
<verse>in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!</verse>
