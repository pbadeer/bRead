<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="28">
<verse>To you, O LORD, I call; my rock, be not deaf to me, lest, if you be silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy, when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your most holy sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>Do not drag me off with the wicked, with the workers of evil, who speak peace with their neighbors while evil is in their hearts.</verse>
<verse>Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their deeds; give to them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.</verse>
<verse>Because they do not regard the works of the LORD or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and build them up no more.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD! for he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed.</verse>
<verse>Oh, save your people and bless your heritage! Be their shepherd and carry them forever.</verse>
