<verse>Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy!</verse>
<verse>For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth.</verse>
<verse>He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.</verse>
<verse>He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah</verse>
<verse>God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.</verse>
<verse>Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!</verse>
<verse>For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!</verse>
<verse>God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.</verse>
<verse>The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!</verse>
