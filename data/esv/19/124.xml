<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="124">
<verse>If it had not been the LORD who was on our side--let Israel now say--</verse>
<verse>if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us,</verse>
<verse>then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;</verse>
<verse>then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;</verse>
<verse>then over us would have gone the raging waters.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth!</verse>
<verse>We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped!</verse>
<verse>Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.</verse>
