<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="42">
<verse>As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.</verse>
<verse>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?</verse>
<verse>My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me continually, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.</verse>
<verse>Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation</verse>
<verse>and my God.My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.</verse>
<verse>Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me.</verse>
<verse>By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.</verse>
<verse>I say to God, my rock: "Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"</verse>
<verse>As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me continually, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.</verse>
