<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="89">
<verse>I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</verse>
<verse>For I said, "Steadfast love will be built up forever; in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness."</verse>
<verse>You have said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant:</verse>
<verse>'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah</verse>
<verse>Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!</verse>
<verse>For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD,</verse>
<verse>a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him?</verse>
<verse>O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you?</verse>
<verse>You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.</verse>
<verse>You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</verse>
<verse>The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.</verse>
<verse>The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.</verse>
<verse>You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.</verse>
<verse>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.</verse>
<verse>Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face,</verse>
<verse>who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted.</verse>
<verse>For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted.</verse>
<verse>For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
<verse>Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: "I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.</verse>
<verse>I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him,</verse>
<verse>so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him.</verse>
<verse>The enemy shall not outwit him; the wicked shall not humble him.</verse>
<verse>I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.</verse>
<verse>My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</verse>
<verse>I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.</verse>
<verse>He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.'</verse>
<verse>And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.</verse>
<verse>My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.</verse>
<verse>I will establish his offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.</verse>
<verse>If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules,</verse>
<verse>if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,</verse>
<verse>then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes,</verse>
<verse>but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.</verse>
<verse>Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.</verse>
<verse>His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me.</verse>
<verse>Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies." Selah</verse>
<verse>But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed.</verse>
<verse>You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.</verse>
<verse>You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.</verse>
<verse>All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</verse>
<verse>You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.</verse>
<verse>You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle.</verse>
<verse>You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground.</verse>
<verse>You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah</verse>
<verse>How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?</verse>
<verse>Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man!</verse>
<verse>What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah</verse>
<verse>Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?</verse>
<verse>Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,</verse>
<verse>with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.</verse>
