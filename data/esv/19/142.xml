<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="142">
<verse>With my voice I cry out to the LORD; with my voice I plead for mercy to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him.</verse>
<verse>When my spirit faints within me, you know my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.</verse>
<verse>Look to the right and see: there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for my soul.</verse>
<verse>I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."</verse>
<verse>Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me!</verse>
<verse>Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name! The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.</verse>
