<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="26">
<verse>Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</verse>
<verse>Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind.</verse>
<verse>For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites.</verse>
<verse>I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.</verse>
<verse>I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O LORD,</verse>
<verse>proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.</verse>
<verse>Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men,</verse>
<verse>in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me.</verse>
<verse>My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.</verse>
