<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="127">
<verse>Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.</verse>
<verse>It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep.</verse>
<verse>Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward.</verse>
<verse>Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.</verse>
