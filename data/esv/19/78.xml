<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="78">
<verse>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth!</verse>
<verse>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,</verse>
<verse>things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.</verse>
<verse>We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.</verse>
<verse>He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children,</verse>
<verse>that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children,</verse>
<verse>so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;</verse>
<verse>and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.</verse>
<verse>The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.</verse>
<verse>They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.</verse>
<verse>They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.</verse>
<verse>In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</verse>
<verse>He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.</verse>
<verse>In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.</verse>
<verse>He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.</verse>
<verse>He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.</verse>
<verse>Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.</verse>
<verse>They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.</verse>
<verse>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?</verse>
<verse>He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?"</verse>
<verse>Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,</verse>
<verse>because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.</verse>
<verse>Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,</verse>
<verse>and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.</verse>
<verse>Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.</verse>
<verse>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;</verse>
<verse>he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;</verse>
<verse>he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.</verse>
<verse>And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.</verse>
<verse>But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,</verse>
<verse>the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.</verse>
<verse>In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe.</verse>
<verse>So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.</verse>
<verse>When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.</verse>
<verse>They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.</verse>
<verse>But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.</verse>
<verse>Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant.</verse>
<verse>Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath.</verse>
<verse>He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.</verse>
<verse>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!</verse>
<verse>They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
<verse>They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,</verse>
<verse>when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.</verse>
<verse>He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.</verse>
<verse>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</verse>
<verse>He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.</verse>
<verse>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.</verse>
<verse>He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.</verse>
<verse>He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.</verse>
<verse>He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.</verse>
<verse>He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.</verse>
<verse>Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</verse>
<verse>He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</verse>
<verse>And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.</verse>
<verse>He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.</verse>
<verse>Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,</verse>
<verse>but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.</verse>
<verse>For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.</verse>
<verse>When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.</verse>
<verse>He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,</verse>
<verse>and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.</verse>
<verse>He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.</verse>
<verse>Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.</verse>
<verse>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</verse>
<verse>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.</verse>
<verse>And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.</verse>
<verse>He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>
<verse>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.</verse>
<verse>He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.</verse>
<verse>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;</verse>
<verse>from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.</verse>
<verse>With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.</verse>
