<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="75">
<verse>We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds.</verse>
<verse>"At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity.</verse>
<verse>When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah</verse>
<verse>I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn;</verse>
<verse>do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'"</verse>
<verse>For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,</verse>
<verse>but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.</verse>
<verse>For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.</verse>
<verse>But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</verse>
