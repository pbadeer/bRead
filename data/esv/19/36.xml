<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="36">
<verse>Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.</verse>
<verse>For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.</verse>
<verse>The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.</verse>
<verse>He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil.</verse>
<verse>Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.</verse>
<verse>Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.</verse>
<verse>They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.</verse>
<verse>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light.</verse>
<verse>Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart!</verse>
<verse>Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</verse>
<verse>There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.</verse>
