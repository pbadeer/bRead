<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="132">
<verse>Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured,</verse>
<verse>how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>"I will not enter my house or get into my bed,</verse>
<verse>I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,</verse>
<verse>until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."</verse>
<verse>Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.</verse>
<verse>"Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!"</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.</verse>
<verse>Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy.</verse>
<verse>For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one.</verse>
<verse>The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.</verse>
<verse>If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne."</verse>
<verse>For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place:</verse>
<verse>"This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</verse>
<verse>I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.</verse>
<verse>Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy.</verse>
<verse>There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.</verse>
<verse>His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."</verse>
