<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="140">
<verse>Deliver me, O LORD, from evil men; preserve me from violent men,</verse>
<verse>who plan evil things in their heart and stir up wars continually.</verse>
<verse>They make their tongue sharp as a serpent's, and under their lips is the venom of asps. Selah</verse>
<verse>Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from violent men, who have planned to trip up my feet.</verse>
<verse>The arrogant have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net; beside the way they have set snares for me. Selah</verse>
<verse>I say to the LORD, You are my God; give ear to the voice of my pleas for mercy, O LORD!</verse>
<verse>O LORD, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.</verse>
<verse>Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plot or they will be exalted! Selah</verse>
<verse>As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!</verse>
<verse>Let burning coals fall upon them! Let them be cast into fire, into miry pits, no more to rise!</verse>
<verse>Let not the slanderer be established in the land; let evil hunt down the violent man speedily!</verse>
<verse>I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will execute justice for the needy.</verse>
<verse>Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall dwell in your presence.</verse>
