<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="1">
<verse>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</verse>
<verse>but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
<verse>He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.</verse>
<verse>The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;</verse>
<verse>for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</verse>
