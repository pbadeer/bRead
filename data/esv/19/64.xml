<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="64">
<verse>Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.</verse>
<verse>Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers,</verse>
<verse>who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,</verse>
<verse>shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear.</verse>
<verse>They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, who can see them?</verse>
<verse>They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!</verse>
<verse>But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly.</verse>
<verse>They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads.</verse>
<verse>Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done.</verse>
<verse>Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!</verse>
