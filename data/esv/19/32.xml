<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="32">
<verse>Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.</verse>
<verse>For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.</verse>
<verse>For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah</verse>
<verse>I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah</verse>
<verse>Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.</verse>
<verse>You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah</verse>
<verse>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.</verse>
<verse>Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you.</verse>
<verse>Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!</verse>
