<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="107">
<verse>Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!</verse>
<verse>Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble</verse>
<verse>and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.</verse>
<verse>Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;</verse>
<verse>hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.</verse>
<verse>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
<verse>He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in.</verse>
<verse>Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men!</verse>
<verse>For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.</verse>
<verse>Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,</verse>
<verse>for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.</verse>
<verse>So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.</verse>
<verse>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
<verse>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart.</verse>
<verse>Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men!</verse>
<verse>For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron.</verse>
<verse>Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;</verse>
<verse>they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.</verse>
<verse>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
<verse>He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.</verse>
<verse>Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men!</verse>
<verse>And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!</verse>
<verse>Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;</verse>
<verse>they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.</verse>
<verse>For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.</verse>
<verse>They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;</verse>
<verse>they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits' end.</verse>
<verse>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
<verse>He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.</verse>
<verse>Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.</verse>
<verse>Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men!</verse>
<verse>Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</verse>
<verse>He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,</verse>
<verse>a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants.</verse>
<verse>He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.</verse>
<verse>And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;</verse>
<verse>they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield.</verse>
<verse>By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish.</verse>
<verse>When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil, and sorrow,</verse>
<verse>he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;</verse>
<verse>but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks.</verse>
<verse>The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.</verse>
<verse>Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.</verse>
