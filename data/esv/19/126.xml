<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="126">
<verse>When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.</verse>
<verse>Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."</verse>
<verse>The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad.</verse>
<verse>Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negeb!</verse>
<verse>Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy!</verse>
<verse>He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.</verse>
