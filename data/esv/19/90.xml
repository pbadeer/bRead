<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="90">
<verse>Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.</verse>
<verse>Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</verse>
<verse>You return man to dust and say, "Return, O children of man!"</verse>
<verse>For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.</verse>
<verse>You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning:</verse>
<verse>in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.</verse>
<verse>For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed.</verse>
<verse>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.</verse>
<verse>For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh.</verse>
<verse>The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.</verse>
<verse>Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you?</verse>
<verse>So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.</verse>
<verse>Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants!</verse>
<verse>Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</verse>
<verse>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil.</verse>
<verse>Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children.</verse>
<verse>Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!</verse>
