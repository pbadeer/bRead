<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="97">
<verse>The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!</verse>
<verse>Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</verse>
<verse>Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around.</verse>
<verse>His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.</verse>
<verse>The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
<verse>The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.</verse>
<verse>All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; worship him, all you gods!</verse>
<verse>Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.</verse>
<verse>O you who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!</verse>
