<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="96">
<verse>Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth!</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.</verse>
<verse>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!</verse>
<verse>For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.</verse>
<verse>For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens.</verse>
<verse>Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts!</verse>
<verse>Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth!</verse>
<verse>Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity."</verse>
<verse>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;</verse>
<verse>let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy</verse>
<verse>before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.</verse>
