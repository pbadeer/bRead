<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="34">
<verse>I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</verse>
<verse>My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad.</verse>
<verse>Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together!</verse>
<verse>I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.</verse>
<verse>Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.</verse>
<verse>This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.</verse>
<verse>The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.</verse>
<verse>Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!</verse>
<verse>Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!</verse>
<verse>The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.</verse>
<verse>Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good?</verse>
<verse>Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
<verse>Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
<verse>The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry.</verse>
<verse>The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.</verse>
<verse>When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.</verse>
<verse>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.</verse>
<verse>He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.</verse>
<verse>Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.</verse>
<verse>The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.</verse>
