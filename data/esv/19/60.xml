<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="60">
<verse>O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us.</verse>
<verse>You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters.</verse>
<verse>You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.</verse>
<verse>You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah</verse>
<verse>That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us!</verse>
<verse>God has spoken in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.</verse>
<verse>Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies.</verse>
<verse>Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!</verse>
<verse>With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.</verse>
