<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="45">
<verse>My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.</verse>
<verse>You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.</verse>
<verse>Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty!</verse>
<verse>In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!</verse>
<verse>Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.</verse>
<verse>Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness;</verse>
<verse>you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;</verse>
<verse>your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;</verse>
<verse>daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.</verse>
<verse>Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house,</verse>
<verse>and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him.</verse>
<verse>The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people.</verse>
<verse>All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold.</verse>
<verse>In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her.</verse>
<verse>With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.</verse>
<verse>In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.</verse>
<verse>I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.</verse>
