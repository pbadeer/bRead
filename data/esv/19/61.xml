<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="61">
<verse>Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer;</verse>
<verse>from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,</verse>
<verse>for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.</verse>
<verse>Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah</verse>
<verse>For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.</verse>
<verse>Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!</verse>
<verse>May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!</verse>
<verse>So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day.</verse>
