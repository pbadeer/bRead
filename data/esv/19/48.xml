<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="48">
<verse>Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,</verse>
<verse>beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.</verse>
<verse>Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.</verse>
<verse>For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.</verse>
<verse>As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight.</verse>
<verse>Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.</verse>
<verse>By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.</verse>
<verse>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah</verse>
<verse>We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.</verse>
<verse>As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.</verse>
<verse>Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!</verse>
<verse>Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers,</verse>
<verse>consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation</verse>
<verse>that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.</verse>
