<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="57">
<verse>Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.</verse>
<verse>I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.</verse>
<verse>He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!</verse>
<verse>My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts--the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!</verse>
<verse>They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah</verse>
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!</verse>
<verse>Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.</verse>
<verse>For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!</verse>
