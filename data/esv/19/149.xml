<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="149">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the godly!</verse>
<verse>Let Israel be glad in his Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King!</verse>
<verse>Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and lyre!</verse>
<verse>For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let the godly exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds.</verse>
<verse>Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,</verse>
<verse>to execute vengeance on the nations and punishments on the peoples,</verse>
<verse>to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron,</verse>
<verse>to execute on them the judgment written! This is honor for all his godly ones. Praise the LORD!</verse>
