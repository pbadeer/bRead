<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="109">
<verse>Be not silent, O God of my praise!</verse>
<verse>For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.</verse>
<verse>They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.</verse>
<verse>In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer.</verse>
<verse>So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</verse>
<verse>Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand at his right hand.</verse>
<verse>When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!</verse>
<verse>May his days be few; may another take his office!</verse>
<verse>May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow!</verse>
<verse>May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit!</verse>
<verse>May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!</verse>
<verse>Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!</verse>
<verse>May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!</verse>
<verse>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!</verse>
<verse>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth!</verse>
<verse>For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death.</verse>
<verse>He loved to curse; let curses come upon him! He did not delight in blessing; may it be far from him!</verse>
<verse>He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!</verse>
<verse>May it be like a garment that he wraps around him, like a belt that he puts on every day!</verse>
<verse>May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life!</verse>
<verse>But you, O GOD my Lord, deal on my behalf for your name's sake; because your steadfast love is good, deliver me!</verse>
<verse>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me.</verse>
<verse>I am gone like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.</verse>
<verse>My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt, with no fat.</verse>
<verse>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads.</verse>
<verse>Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to your steadfast love!</verse>
<verse>Let them know that this is your hand; you, O LORD, have done it!</verse>
<verse>Let them curse, but you will bless! They arise and are put to shame, but your servant will be glad!</verse>
<verse>May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!</verse>
<verse>With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.</verse>
<verse>For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.</verse>
