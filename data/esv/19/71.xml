<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="71">
<verse>In you, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame!</verse>
<verse>In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me, and save me!</verse>
<verse>Be to me a rock of refuge, to which I may continually come; you have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.</verse>
<verse>Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.</verse>
<verse>For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth.</verse>
<verse>Upon you I have leaned from before my birth; you are he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of you.</verse>
<verse>I have been as a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.</verse>
<verse>My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all the day.</verse>
<verse>Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent.</verse>
<verse>For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together</verse>
<verse>and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him."</verse>
<verse>O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!</verse>
<verse>May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt.</verse>
<verse>But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more.</verse>
<verse>My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge.</verse>
<verse>With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone.</verse>
<verse>O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.</verse>
<verse>So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come.</verse>
<verse>Your righteousness, O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?</verse>
<verse>You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.</verse>
<verse>You will increase my greatness and comfort me again.</verse>
<verse>I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.</verse>
<verse>My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed.</verse>
<verse>And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt.</verse>
