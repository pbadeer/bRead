<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="108">
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God! I will sing and make melody with all my being!</verse>
<verse>Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.</verse>
<verse>For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!</verse>
<verse>That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me!</verse>
<verse>God has promised in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.</verse>
<verse>Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.</verse>
<verse>Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!</verse>
<verse>With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.</verse>
