<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="137">
<verse>By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.</verse>
<verse>On the willows there we hung up our lyres.</verse>
<verse>For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</verse>
<verse>How shall we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?</verse>
<verse>If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill!</verse>
<verse>Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy!</verse>
<verse>Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, "Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!"</verse>
<verse>O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed, blessed shall he be who repays you with what you have done to us!</verse>
<verse>Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!</verse>
