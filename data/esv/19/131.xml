<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="131">
<verse>O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.</verse>
<verse>But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.</verse>
