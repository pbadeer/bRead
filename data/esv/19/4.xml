<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="4">
<verse>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!</verse>
<verse>O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah</verse>
<verse>But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him.</verse>
<verse>Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah</verse>
<verse>Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!"</verse>
<verse>You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.</verse>
<verse>In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.</verse>
