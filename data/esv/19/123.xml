<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="123">
<verse>To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!</verse>
<verse>Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he has mercy upon us.</verse>
<verse>Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt.</verse>
<verse>Our soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.</verse>
