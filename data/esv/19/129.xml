<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="129">
<verse>"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth"--let Israel now say--</verse>
<verse>"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.</verse>
<verse>The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows."</verse>
<verse>The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward!</verse>
<verse>Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up,</verse>
<verse>with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms,</verse>
<verse>nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"</verse>
