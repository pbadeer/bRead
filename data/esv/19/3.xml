<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="3">
<verse>O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;</verse>
<verse>many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.</verse>
<verse>I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah</verse>
<verse>I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the LORD sustained me.</verse>
<verse>I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing be on your people! Selah</verse>
