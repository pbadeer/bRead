<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="122">
<verse>I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD!"</verse>
<verse>Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!</verse>
<verse>Jerusalem--built as a city that is bound firmly together,</verse>
<verse>to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David.</verse>
<verse>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! "May they be secure who love you!</verse>
<verse>Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!"</verse>
<verse>For my brothers and companions' sake I will say, "Peace be within you!"</verse>
<verse>For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.</verse>
