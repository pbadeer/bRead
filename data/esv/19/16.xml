<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="16">
<verse>Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.</verse>
<verse>I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you."</verse>
<verse>As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.</verse>
<verse>The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.</verse>
<verse>The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.</verse>
<verse>I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.</verse>
<verse>I have set the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.</verse>
<verse>For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.</verse>
<verse>You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</verse>
