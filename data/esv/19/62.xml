<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="62">
<verse>For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.</verse>
<verse>He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.</verse>
<verse>How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?</verse>
<verse>They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah</verse>
<verse>For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him.</verse>
<verse>He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God.</verse>
<verse>Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah</verse>
<verse>Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.</verse>
<verse>Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them.</verse>
<verse>Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,</verse>
<verse>and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.</verse>
