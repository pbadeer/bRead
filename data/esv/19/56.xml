<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="56">
<verse>Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me;</verse>
<verse>my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly.</verse>
<verse>When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?</verse>
<verse>All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.</verse>
<verse>They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.</verse>
<verse>For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!</verse>
<verse>You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?</verse>
<verse>Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,</verse>
<verse>in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?</verse>
<verse>I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.</verse>
<verse>For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.</verse>
