<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="6">
<verse>O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.</verse>
<verse>Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled.</verse>
<verse>My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O LORD--how long?</verse>
<verse>Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.</verse>
<verse>For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?</verse>
<verse>I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.</verse>
<verse>My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.</verse>
<verse>Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD accepts my prayer.</verse>
<verse>All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.</verse>
