<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="14">
<verse>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good.</verse>
<verse>The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.</verse>
<verse>They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD?</verse>
<verse>There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>You would shame the plans of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.</verse>
