<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="72">
<verse>Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son!</verse>
<verse>May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice!</verse>
<verse>Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness!</verse>
<verse>May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor!</verse>
<verse>May they fear you while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations!</verse>
<verse>May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth!</verse>
<verse>In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more!</verse>
<verse>May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!</verse>
<verse>May desert tribes bow down before him and his enemies lick the dust!</verse>
<verse>May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!</verse>
<verse>May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him!</verse>
<verse>For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper.</verse>
<verse>He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy.</verse>
<verse>From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight.</verse>
<verse>Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day!</verse>
<verse>May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field!</verse>
<verse>May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed!</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen!</verse>
<verse>The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.</verse>
