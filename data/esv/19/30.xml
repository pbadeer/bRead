<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="30">
<verse>I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.</verse>
<verse>For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."</verse>
<verse>By your favor, O LORD, you made my mountain stand strong; you hid your face; I was dismayed.</verse>
<verse>To you, O LORD, I cry, and to the Lord I plead for mercy:</verse>
<verse>"What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?</verse>
<verse>Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me! O LORD, be my helper!"</verse>
<verse>You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,</verse>
<verse>that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever!</verse>
