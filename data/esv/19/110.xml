<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="110">
<verse>The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."</verse>
<verse>The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies!</verse>
<verse>Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
<verse>The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.</verse>
<verse>He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth.</verse>
<verse>He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head.</verse>
