<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="53">
<verse>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good.</verse>
<verse>God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.</verse>
<verse>They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?</verse>
<verse>There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.</verse>
