<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="18">
<verse>I love you, O LORD, my strength.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</verse>
<verse>I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</verse>
<verse>The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;</verse>
<verse>the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.</verse>
<verse>In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</verse>
<verse>Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</verse>
<verse>Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</verse>
<verse>He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</verse>
<verse>He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.</verse>
<verse>He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.</verse>
<verse>Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.</verse>
<verse>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
<verse>And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.</verse>
<verse>Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</verse>
<verse>He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.</verse>
<verse>He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</verse>
<verse>They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.</verse>
<verse>He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
<verse>The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.</verse>
<verse>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
<verse>For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</verse>
<verse>I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.</verse>
<verse>So the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</verse>
<verse>With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;</verse>
<verse>with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.</verse>
<verse>For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.</verse>
<verse>For it is you who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.</verse>
<verse>For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.</verse>
<verse>This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
<verse>For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--</verse>
<verse>the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.</verse>
<verse>He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.</verse>
<verse>He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
<verse>You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.</verse>
<verse>You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</verse>
<verse>I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.</verse>
<verse>I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</verse>
<verse>For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.</verse>
<verse>You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</verse>
<verse>They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</verse>
<verse>I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</verse>
<verse>You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</verse>
<verse>As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</verse>
<verse>Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.</verse>
<verse>The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation--</verse>
<verse>the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,</verse>
<verse>who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.</verse>
<verse>For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.</verse>
<verse>Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.</verse>
