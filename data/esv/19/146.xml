<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="146">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!</verse>
<verse>I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.</verse>
<verse>Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.</verse>
<verse>When his breath departs he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,</verse>
<verse>who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever;</verse>
<verse>who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry.The LORD sets the prisoners free;</verse>
<verse>the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.</verse>
<verse>The LORD watches over the sojourners; he upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!</verse>
