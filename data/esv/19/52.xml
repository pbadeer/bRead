<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="52">
<verse>Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day.</verse>
<verse>Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.</verse>
<verse>You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah</verse>
<verse>You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.</verse>
<verse>But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</verse>
<verse>The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,</verse>
<verse>"See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!"</verse>
<verse>But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.</verse>
