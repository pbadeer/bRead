<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="63">
<verse>O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.</verse>
<verse>So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.</verse>
<verse>Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.</verse>
<verse>So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands.</verse>
<verse>My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,</verse>
<verse>when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;</verse>
<verse>for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.</verse>
<verse>My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.</verse>
<verse>But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;</verse>
<verse>they shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for jackals.</verse>
<verse>But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.</verse>
