<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="114">
<verse>When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,</verse>
<verse>Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</verse>
<verse>The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back.</verse>
<verse>The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.</verse>
<verse>What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?</verse>
<verse>O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?</verse>
<verse>Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.</verse>
