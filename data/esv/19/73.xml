<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="73">
<verse>Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped.</verse>
<verse>For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek.</verse>
<verse>They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.</verse>
<verse>Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment.</verse>
<verse>Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.</verse>
<verse>They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.</verse>
<verse>They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.</verse>
<verse>Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them.</verse>
<verse>And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"</verse>
<verse>Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.</verse>
<verse>All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.</verse>
<verse>For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning.</verse>
<verse>If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</verse>
<verse>But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,</verse>
<verse>until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end.</verse>
<verse>Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.</verse>
<verse>How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!</verse>
<verse>Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms.</verse>
<verse>When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,</verse>
<verse>I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you.</verse>
<verse>Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.</verse>
<verse>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory.</verse>
<verse>Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.</verse>
<verse>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</verse>
<verse>For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.</verse>
<verse>But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.</verse>
