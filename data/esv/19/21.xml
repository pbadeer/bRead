<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="21">
<verse>O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults!</verse>
<verse>You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</verse>
<verse>For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head.</verse>
<verse>He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him.</verse>
<verse>For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence.</verse>
<verse>For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.</verse>
<verse>Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you.</verse>
<verse>You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them.</verse>
<verse>You will destroy their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from among the children of man.</verse>
<verse>Though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed.</verse>
<verse>For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.</verse>
