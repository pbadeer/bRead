<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="51">
<verse>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.</verse>
<verse>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!</verse>
<verse>For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.</verse>
<verse>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.</verse>
<verse>Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</verse>
<verse>Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.</verse>
<verse>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</verse>
<verse>Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.</verse>
<verse>Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</verse>
<verse>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</verse>
<verse>Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.</verse>
<verse>Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</verse>
<verse>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.</verse>
<verse>O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.</verse>
<verse>For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.</verse>
<verse>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</verse>
<verse>Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;</verse>
<verse>then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</verse>
