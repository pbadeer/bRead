<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="144">
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;</verse>
<verse>he is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, what is man that you regard him, or the son of man that you think of him?</verse>
<verse>Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.</verse>
<verse>Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down! Touch the mountains so that they smoke!</verse>
<verse>Flash forth the lightning and scatter them; send out your arrows and rout them!</verse>
<verse>Stretch out your hand from on high; rescue me and deliver me from the many waters, from the hand of foreigners,</verse>
<verse>whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</verse>
<verse>I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you,</verse>
<verse>who gives victory to kings, who rescues David his servant from the cruel sword.</verse>
<verse>Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</verse>
<verse>May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace;</verse>
<verse>may our granaries be full, providing all kinds of produce; may our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;</verse>
<verse>may our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no mishap or failure in bearing; may there be no cry of distress in our streets!</verse>
<verse>Blessed are the people to whom such blessings fall! Blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!</verse>
