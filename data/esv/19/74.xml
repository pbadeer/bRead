<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="74">
<verse>O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?</verse>
<verse>Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.</verse>
<verse>Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!</verse>
<verse>Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they set up their own signs for signs.</verse>
<verse>They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees.</verse>
<verse>And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers.</verse>
<verse>They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground.</verse>
<verse>They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.</verse>
<verse>We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long.</verse>
<verse>How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever?</verse>
<verse>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them!</verse>
<verse>Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</verse>
<verse>You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.</verse>
<verse>You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.</verse>
<verse>You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.</verse>
<verse>Yours is the day, yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun.</verse>
<verse>You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter.</verse>
<verse>Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name.</verse>
<verse>Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever.</verse>
<verse>Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.</verse>
<verse>Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day!</verse>
<verse>Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!</verse>
