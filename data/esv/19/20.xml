<verse>May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you!</verse>
<verse>May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion!</verse>
<verse>May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! Selah</verse>
<verse>May he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans!</verse>
<verse>May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the LORD fulfill all your petitions!</verse>
<verse>Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand.</verse>
<verse>Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.</verse>
<verse>They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, save the king! May he answer us when we call.</verse>
