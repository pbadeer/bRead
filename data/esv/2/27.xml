<verse>"You shall make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits broad. The altar shall be square, and its height shall be three cubits.</verse>
<verse>And you shall make horns for it on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it, and you shall overlay it with bronze.</verse>
<verse>You shall make pots for it to receive its ashes, and shovels and basins and forks and fire pans. You shall make all its utensils of bronze.</verse>
<verse>You shall also make for it a grating, a network of bronze, and on the net you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.</verse>
<verse>And you shall set it under the ledge of the altar so that the net extends halfway down the altar.</verse>
<verse>And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.</verse>
<verse>And the poles shall be put through the rings, so that the poles are on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.</verse>
<verse>You shall make it hollow, with boards. As it has been shown you on the mountain, so shall it be made.</verse>

<verse>The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, the breadth fifty, and the height five cubits, with hangings of fine twined linen and bases of bronze.</verse>
<verse>All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, and all its pegs and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze.</verse>
<verse>"You shall command the people of Israel that they bring to you pure beaten olive oil for the light, that a lamp may regularly be set up to burn.</verse>
<verse>In the tent of meeting, outside the veil that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening to morning before the LORD. It shall be a statute forever to be observed throughout their generations by the people of Israel.</verse>
