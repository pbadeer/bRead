<verse>But the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."</verse>
<verse>God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.</verse>
<verse>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.</verse>
<verse>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
<verse>Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.</verse>
<verse>I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</verse>
<verse>I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'"</verse>
<verse>Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.</verse>
<verse>So the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
<verse>"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land."</verse>
<verse>But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?"</verse>
<verse>But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt: to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
<verse>These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the clans of Reuben.</verse>

<verse>These are the Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said: "Bring out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts."</verse>
<verse>It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.</verse>
<verse>On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,</verse>
<verse>the LORD said to Moses, "I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you."</verse>
<verse>But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?"</verse>
