<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="3">
<verse>My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</verse>
<verse>for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</verse>
<verse>Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
<verse>So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</verse>
<verse>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</verse>
<verse>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</verse>
<verse>Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</verse>
<verse>It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</verse>
<verse>Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</verse>
<verse>then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</verse>
<verse>My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</verse>
<verse>for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
<verse>Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</verse>
<verse>for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</verse>
<verse>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</verse>
<verse>Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
<verse>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
<verse>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</verse>
<verse>The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</verse>
<verse>by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
<verse>My son, do not lose sight of these--keep sound wisdom and discretion,</verse>
<verse>and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</verse>
<verse>Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</verse>
<verse>If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
<verse>Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</verse>
<verse>for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</verse>
<verse>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</verse>
<verse>Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you.</verse>
<verse>Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</verse>
<verse>Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</verse>
<verse>Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</verse>
<verse>for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</verse>
<verse>The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</verse>
<verse>The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</verse>
