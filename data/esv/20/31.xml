<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="31">
<verse>The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:</verse>
<verse>What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows?</verse>
<verse>Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.</verse>
<verse>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,</verse>
<verse>lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</verse>
<verse>Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;</verse>
<verse>let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</verse>
<verse>Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.</verse>
<verse>Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.</verse>
<verse>An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.</verse>
<verse>The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.</verse>
<verse>She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</verse>
<verse>She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.</verse>
<verse>She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.</verse>
<verse>She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.</verse>
<verse>She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</verse>
<verse>She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.</verse>
<verse>She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.</verse>
<verse>She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</verse>
<verse>She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.</verse>
<verse>She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.</verse>
<verse>She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</verse>
<verse>Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.</verse>
<verse>She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.</verse>
<verse>Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.</verse>
<verse>She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</verse>
<verse>She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</verse>
<verse>Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</verse>
<verse>"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all."</verse>
<verse>Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</verse>
<verse>Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.</verse>
