<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="2">
<verse>My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</verse>
<verse>making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</verse>
<verse>yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</verse>
<verse>if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</verse>
<verse>then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</verse>
<verse>he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
<verse>guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</verse>
<verse>Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</verse>
<verse>for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
<verse>discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</verse>
<verse>delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</verse>
<verse>who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
<verse>who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</verse>
<verse>men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
<verse>So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</verse>
<verse>who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</verse>
<verse>for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</verse>
<verse>none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</verse>
<verse>So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</verse>
<verse>but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
