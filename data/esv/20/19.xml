<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="19">
<verse>Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.</verse>
<verse>Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.</verse>
<verse>When a man's folly brings his way to ruin, his heart rages against the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</verse>
<verse>A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will not escape.</verse>
<verse>Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</verse>
<verse>All a poor man's brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues them with words, but does not have them.</verse>
<verse>Whoever gets sense loves his own soul; he who keeps understanding will discover good.</verse>
<verse>A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will perish.</verse>
<verse>It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury, much less for a slave to rule over princes.</verse>
<verse>Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense.</verse>
<verse>A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</verse>
<verse>A foolish son is ruin to his father, and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain.</verse>
<verse>House and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and an idle person will suffer hunger.</verse>
<verse>Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life; he who despises his ways will die.</verse>
<verse>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his deed.</verse>
<verse>Discipline your son, for there is hope; do not set your heart on putting him to death.</verse>
<verse>A man of great wrath will pay the penalty, for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.</verse>
<verse>Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future.</verse>
<verse>Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.</verse>
<verse>What is desired in a man is steadfast love, and a poor man is better than a liar.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.</verse>
<verse>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not even bring it back to his mouth.</verse>
<verse>Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</verse>
<verse>He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and reproach.</verse>
<verse>Cease to hear instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.</verse>
<verse>A worthless witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</verse>
<verse>Condemnation is ready for scoffers, and beating for the backs of fools.</verse>
