<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="23">
<verse>When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you,</verse>
<verse>and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite.</verse>
<verse>Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.</verse>
<verse>Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist.</verse>
<verse>When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven.</verse>
<verse>Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy; do not desire his delicacies,</verse>
<verse>for he is like one who is inwardly calculating. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</verse>
<verse>You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words.</verse>
<verse>Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the good sense of your words.</verse>
<verse>Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless,</verse>
<verse>for their Redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you.</verse>
<verse>Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge.</verse>
<verse>Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die.</verse>
<verse>If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol.</verse>
<verse>My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad.</verse>
<verse>My inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right.</verse>
<verse>Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day.</verse>
<verse>Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</verse>
<verse>Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way.</verse>
<verse>Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat,</verse>
<verse>for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags.</verse>
<verse>Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.</verse>
<verse>Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.</verse>
<verse>The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him.</verse>
<verse>Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.</verse>
<verse>My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.</verse>
<verse>For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well.</verse>
<verse>She lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind.</verse>
<verse>Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?</verse>
<verse>Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine.</verse>
<verse>Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.</verse>
<verse>In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder.</verse>
<verse>Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart utter perverse things.</verse>
<verse>You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast.</verse>
<verse>"They struck me," you will say, "but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink."</verse>
