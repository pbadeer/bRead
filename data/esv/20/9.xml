<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="9">
<verse>Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.</verse>
<verse>She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</verse>
<verse>She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town,</verse>
<verse>"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says,</verse>
<verse>"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.</verse>
<verse>Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight."</verse>
<verse>Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.</verse>
<verse>Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</verse>
<verse>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</verse>
<verse>For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.</verse>
<verse>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it.</verse>
<verse>The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing.</verse>
<verse>She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,</verse>
<verse>calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,</verse>
<verse>"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says,</verse>
<verse>"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."</verse>
<verse>But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</verse>
