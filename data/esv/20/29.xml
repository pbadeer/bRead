<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="29">
<verse>He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck, will suddenly be broken beyond healing.</verse>
<verse>When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.</verse>
<verse>He who loves wisdom makes his father glad, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.</verse>
<verse>By justice a king builds up the land, but he who exacts gifts tears it down.</verse>
<verse>A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.</verse>
<verse>An evil man is ensnared in his transgression, but a righteous man sings and rejoices.</verse>
<verse>A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.</verse>
<verse>Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath.</verse>
<verse>If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.</verse>
<verse>Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the upright.</verse>
<verse>A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back.</verse>
<verse>If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials will be wicked.</verse>
<verse>The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.</verse>
<verse>If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.</verse>
<verse>The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.</verse>
<verse>When the wicked increase, transgression increases, but the righteous will look upon their downfall.</verse>
<verse>Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your heart.</verse>
<verse>Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.</verse>
<verse>By mere words a servant is not disciplined, for though he understands, he will not respond.</verse>
<verse>Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</verse>
<verse>Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir.</verse>
<verse>A man of wrath stirs up strife, and one given to anger causes much transgression.</verse>
<verse>One's pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.</verse>
<verse>The partner of a thief hates his own life; he hears the curse, but discloses nothing.</verse>
<verse>The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.</verse>
<verse>Many seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that a man gets justice.</verse>
<verse>An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked.</verse>
