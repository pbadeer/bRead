<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="15">
<verse>A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.</verse>
<verse>The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouths of fools pour out folly.</verse>
<verse>The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.</verse>
<verse>A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.</verse>
<verse>A fool despises his father's instruction, but whoever heeds reproof is prudent.</verse>
<verse>In the house of the righteous there is much treasure, but trouble befalls the income of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so the hearts of fools.</verse>
<verse>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but the prayer of the upright is acceptable to him.</verse>
<verse>The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but he loves him who pursues righteousness.</verse>
<verse>There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way; whoever hates reproof will die.</verse>
<verse>Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD; how much more the hearts of the children of man!</verse>
<verse>A scoffer does not like to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.</verse>
<verse>A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed.</verse>
<verse>The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly.</verse>
<verse>All the days of the afflicted are evil, but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast.</verse>
<verse>Better is a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble with it.</verse>
<verse>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it.</verse>
<verse>A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.</verse>
<verse>The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a level highway.</verse>
<verse>A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man despises his mother.</verse>
<verse>Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense, but a man of understanding walks straight ahead.</verse>
<verse>Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed.</verse>
<verse>To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is!</verse>
<verse>The path of life leads upward for the prudent, that he may turn away from Sheol beneath.</verse>
<verse>The LORD tears down the house of the proud but maintains the widow's boundaries.</verse>
<verse>The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD, but gracious words are pure.</verse>
<verse>Whoever is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household, but he who hates bribes will live.</verse>
<verse>The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.</verse>
<verse>The ear that listens to life-giving reproof will dwell among the wise.</verse>
<verse>Whoever ignores instruction despises himself, but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom, and humility comes before honor.</verse>
