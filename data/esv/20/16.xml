<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="16">
<verse>The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.</verse>
<verse>All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirit.</verse>
<verse>Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble.</verse>
<verse>Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the LORD; be assured, he will not go unpunished.</verse>
<verse>By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil.</verse>
<verse>When a man's ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</verse>
<verse>Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice.</verse>
<verse>The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps.</verse>
<verse>An oracle is on the lips of a king; his mouth does not sin in judgment.</verse>
<verse>A just balance and scales are the LORD's; all the weights in the bag are his work.</verse>
<verse>It is an abomination to kings to do evil, for the throne is established by righteousness.</verse>
<verse>Righteous lips are the delight of a king, and he loves him who speaks what is right.</verse>
<verse>A king's wrath is a messenger of death, and a wise man will appease it.</verse>
<verse>In the light of a king's face there is life, and his favor is like the clouds that bring the spring rain.</verse>
<verse>How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</verse>
<verse>The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; whoever guards his way preserves his life.</verse>
<verse>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</verse>
<verse>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud.</verse>
<verse>Whoever gives thought to the word will discover good, and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>The wise of heart is called discerning, and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness.</verse>
<verse>Good sense is a fountain of life to him who has it, but the instruction of fools is folly.</verse>
<verse>The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious and adds persuasiveness to his lips.</verse>
<verse>Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.</verse>
<verse>There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.</verse>
<verse>A worker's appetite works for him; his mouth urges him on.</verse>
<verse>A worthless man plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire.</verse>
<verse>A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.</verse>
<verse>A man of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good.</verse>
<verse>Whoever winks his eyes plans dishonest things; he who purses his lips brings evil to pass.</verse>
<verse>Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained in a righteous life.</verse>
<verse>Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.</verse>
<verse>The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.</verse>
