<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="30">
<verse>The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man declares, I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out.</verse>
<verse>Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.</verse>
<verse>I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.</verse>
<verse>Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know!</verse>
<verse>Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</verse>
<verse>Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.</verse>
<verse>Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die:</verse>
<verse>Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,</verse>
<verse>lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.</verse>
<verse>Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you and you be held guilty.</verse>
<verse>There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.</verse>
<verse>There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth.</verse>
<verse>There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!</verse>
<verse>There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.</verse>
<verse>The leech has two daughters; "Give" and "Give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":</verse>
<verse>Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough."</verse>
<verse>The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.</verse>
<verse>Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:</verse>
<verse>the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin.</verse>
<verse>This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wrong."</verse>
<verse>Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:</verse>
<verse>a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;</verse>
<verse>an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</verse>
<verse>Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</verse>
<verse>the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</verse>
<verse>the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;</verse>
<verse>the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;</verse>
<verse>the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.</verse>
<verse>Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:</verse>
<verse>the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;</verse>
<verse>the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.</verse>
<verse>If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.</verse>
<verse>For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.</verse>
