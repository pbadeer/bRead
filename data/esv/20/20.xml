<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="20">
<verse>Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.</verse>
<verse>The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion; whoever provokes him to anger forfeits his life.</verse>
<verse>It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling.</verse>
<verse>The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing.</verse>
<verse>The purpose in a man's heart is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out.</verse>
<verse>Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find?</verse>
<verse>The righteous who walks in his integrity--blessed are his children after him!</verse>
<verse>A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil with his eyes.</verse>
<verse>Who can say, "I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin"?</verse>
<verse>Unequal weights and unequal measures are both alike an abomination to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Even a child makes himself known by his acts, by whether his conduct is pure and upright.</verse>
<verse>The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the LORD has made them both.</verse>
<verse>Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.</verse>
<verse>"Bad, Bad," says the buyer, but when he goes away, then he boasts.</verse>
<verse>There is gold and abundance of costly stones, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</verse>
<verse>Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners.</verse>
<verse>Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.</verse>
<verse>Plans are established by counsel; by wise guidance wage war.</verse>
<verse>Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a simple babbler.</verse>
<verse>If one curses his father or his mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.</verse>
<verse>An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end.</verse>
<verse>Do not say, "I will repay evil"; wait for the LORD, and he will deliver you.</verse>
<verse>Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD, and false scales are not good.</verse>
<verse>A man's steps are from the LORD; how then can man understand his way?</verse>
<verse>It is a snare to say rashly, "It is holy," and to reflect only after making vows.</verse>
<verse>A wise king winnows the wicked and drives the wheel over them.</verse>
<verse>The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all his innermost parts.</verse>
<verse>Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king, and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.</verse>
<verse>The glory of young men is their strength, but the splendor of old men is their gray hair.</verse>
<verse>Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.</verse>
