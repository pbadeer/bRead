<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Matthew" book_id="40" n="28">
<verse>Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</verse>
<verse>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.</verse>
<verse>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
<verse>And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.</verse>
<verse>But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
<verse>He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</verse>
<verse>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you."</verse>
<verse>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
<verse>And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
<verse>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."</verse>
<verse>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.</verse>
<verse>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers</verse>
<verse>and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</verse>
<verse>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</verse>
<verse>So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
<verse>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.</verse>
<verse>And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted.</verse>
<verse>And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
<verse>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
<verse>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."</verse>
