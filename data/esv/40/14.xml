<verse>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,</verse>
<verse>and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."</verse>
<verse>For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,</verse>
<verse>because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</verse>
<verse>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.</verse>
<verse>But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,</verse>
<verse>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</verse>
<verse>Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."</verse>
<verse>And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.</verse>
<verse>He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,</verse>
<verse>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
<verse>And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.</verse>
<verse>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
<verse>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</verse>
<verse>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."</verse>
<verse>But Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."</verse>
<verse>They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."</verse>
<verse>And he said, "Bring them here to me."</verse>
<verse>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
<verse>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</verse>
<verse>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
<verse>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.</verse>
<verse>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</verse>
<verse>but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.</verse>
<verse>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
<verse>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.</verse>
<verse>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."</verse>
<verse>And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."</verse>
<verse>He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.</verse>
<verse>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me."</verse>
<verse>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</verse>
<verse>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
<verse>And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</verse>
<verse>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
<verse>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick</verse>
<verse>and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.</verse>
