<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Galatians" book_id="48" n="6">
<verse>Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.</verse>
<verse>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
<verse>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
<verse>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.</verse>
<verse>For each will have to bear his own load.</verse>
<verse>One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.</verse>
<verse>Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.</verse>
<verse>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
<verse>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.</verse>
<verse>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
<verse>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</verse>
<verse>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
<verse>For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
<verse>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
<verse>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
<verse>And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
<verse>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
<verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</verse>
