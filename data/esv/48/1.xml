<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Galatians" book_id="48" n="1">
<verse>Paul, an apostle--not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--</verse>
<verse>and all the brothers who are with me,To the churches of Galatia:</verse>
<verse>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
<verse>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
<verse>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
<verse>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</verse>
<verse>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.</verse>
<verse>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
<verse>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</verse>
<verse>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
<verse>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel.</verse>
<verse>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.</verse>
<verse>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
<verse>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace,</verse>
<verse>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone;</verse>
<verse>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
<verse>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days.</verse>
<verse>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.</verse>
<verse>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)</verse>
<verse>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
<verse>And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</verse>
<verse>They only were hearing it said, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</verse>
<verse>And they glorified God because of me.</verse>
