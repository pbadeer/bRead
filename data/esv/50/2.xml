<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Philippians" book-id="50" n="2">
<verse>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,</verse>
<verse>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.</verse>
<verse>Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.</verse>
<verse>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.</verse>
<verse>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
<verse>but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.</verse>
<verse>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.</verse>
<verse>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,</verse>
<verse>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</verse>
<verse>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
<verse>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,</verse>
<verse>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</verse>
<verse>Do all things without grumbling or questioning,</verse>
<verse>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
<verse>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
<verse>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</verse>
<verse>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
<verse>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.</verse>
<verse>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.</verse>
<verse>They all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>
<verse>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me,</verse>
<verse>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</verse>
<verse>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need,</verse>
<verse>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.</verse>
<verse>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
<verse>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.</verse>
<verse>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men,</verse>
<verse>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</verse>
