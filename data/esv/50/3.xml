<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Philippians" book-id="50" n="3">
<verse>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.</verse>
<verse>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.</verse>
<verse>For we are the real circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh--</verse>
<verse>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:</verse>
<verse>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
<verse>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness, under the law blameless.</verse>
<verse>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
<verse>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
<verse>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith--</verse>
<verse>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</verse>
<verse>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
<verse>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</verse>
<verse>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</verse>
<verse>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.</verse>
<verse>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</verse>
<verse>Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.</verse>
<verse>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
<verse>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.</verse>
<verse>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
<verse>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
