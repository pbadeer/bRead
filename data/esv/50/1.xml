<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Philippians" book-id="50" n="1">
<verse>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:</verse>
<verse>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,</verse>
<verse>always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,</verse>
<verse>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.</verse>
<verse>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.</verse>
<verse>For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment,</verse>
<verse>so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,</verse>
<verse>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
<verse>I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,</verse>
<verse>so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.</verse>
<verse>And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
<verse>Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.</verse>
<verse>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
<verse>The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.</verse>
<verse>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,</verse>
<verse>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,</verse>
<verse>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
<verse>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
<verse>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.</verse>
<verse>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.</verse>
<verse>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.</verse>
<verse>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
<verse>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</verse>
<verse>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
<verse>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.</verse>
<verse>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,</verse>
<verse>engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</verse>
