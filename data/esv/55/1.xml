<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="2 Timothy" book_id="55" n="1">
<verse>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>To Timothy, my beloved child:Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
<verse>I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.</verse>
<verse>As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy.</verse>
<verse>I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.</verse>
<verse>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands,</verse>
<verse>for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.</verse>
<verse>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,</verse>
<verse>who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,</verse>
<verse>and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</verse>
<verse>for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher,</verse>
<verse>which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.</verse>
<verse>Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.</verse>
<verse>You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
<verse>May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,</verse>
<verse>but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me--</verse>
<verse>may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day!--and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.</verse>
