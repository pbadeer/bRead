<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="2 Timothy" book_id="55" n="2">
<verse>You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
<verse>Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
<verse>No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.</verse>
<verse>An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.</verse>
<verse>It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.</verse>
<verse>Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</verse>
<verse>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel,</verse>
<verse>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!</verse>
<verse>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
<verse>The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;</verse>
<verse>if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;</verse>
<verse>if we are faithless, he remains faithful--for he cannot deny himself.</verse>
<verse>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.</verse>
<verse>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</verse>
<verse>But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,</verse>
<verse>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
<verse>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.</verse>
<verse>But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."</verse>
<verse>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.</verse>
<verse>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</verse>
<verse>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</verse>
<verse>Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.</verse>
<verse>And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil,</verse>
<verse>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth,</verse>
<verse>and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</verse>
