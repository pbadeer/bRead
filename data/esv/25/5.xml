<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Lamentations" book_id="25" n="5">
<verse>Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace!</verse>
<verse>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.</verse>
<verse>We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows.</verse>
<verse>We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought.</verse>
<verse>Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest.</verse>
<verse>We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough.</verse>
<verse>Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities.</verse>
<verse>Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand.</verse>
<verse>We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness.</verse>
<verse>Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine.</verse>
<verse>Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah.</verse>
<verse>Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders.</verse>
<verse>Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood.</verse>
<verse>The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music.</verse>
<verse>The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning.</verse>
<verse>The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!</verse>
<verse>For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim,</verse>
<verse>for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it.</verse>
<verse>But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations.</verse>
<verse>Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days?</verse>
<verse>Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old--</verse>
<verse>unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us.</verse>
