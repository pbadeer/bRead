<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="Lamentations" book-id="25" n="3">
<verse>I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath;</verse>
<verse>he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;</verse>
<verse>surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long.</verse>
<verse>He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; he has broken my bones;</verse>
<verse>he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;</verse>
<verse>he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago.</verse>
<verse>He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has made my chains heavy;</verse>
<verse>though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;</verse>
<verse>he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones; he has made my paths crooked.</verse>
<verse>He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;</verse>
<verse>he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;</verse>
<verse>he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow.</verse>
<verse>He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver;</verse>
<verse>I have become the laughingstock of all peoples, the object of their taunts all day long.</verse>
<verse>He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood.</verse>
<verse>He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;</verse>
<verse>my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;</verse>
<verse>so I say, "My endurance has perished; so has my hope from the LORD."</verse>
<verse>Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall!</verse>
<verse>My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me.</verse>
<verse>But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:</verse>
<verse>The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end;</verse>
<verse>they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."</verse>
<verse>The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.</verse>
<verse>It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</verse>
<verse>Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him;</verse>
<verse>let him put his mouth in the dust--there may yet be hope;</verse>
<verse>let him give his cheek to the one who strikes, and let him be filled with insults.</verse>
<verse>For the Lord will not cast off forever,</verse>
<verse>but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;</verse>
<verse>for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men.</verse>
<verse>To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth,</verse>
<verse>to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High,</verse>
<verse>to subvert a man in his lawsuit, the Lord does not approve.</verse>
<verse>Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it?</verse>
<verse>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?</verse>
<verse>Why should a living man complain, a man, about the punishment of his sins?</verse>
<verse>Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD!</verse>
<verse>Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:</verse>
<verse>"We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.</verse>
<verse>"You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;</verse>
<verse>you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.</verse>
<verse>You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples.</verse>
<verse>"All our enemies open their mouths against us;</verse>
<verse>panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction;</verse>
<verse>my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
<verse>"My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,</verse>
<verse>until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees;</verse>
<verse>my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
<verse>"I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause;</verse>
<verse>they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me;</verse>
<verse>water closed over my head; I said, 'I am lost.'</verse>
<verse>"I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit;</verse>
<verse>you heard my plea, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help!'</verse>
<verse>You came near when I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear!'</verse>
<verse>"You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life.</verse>
<verse>You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause.</verse>
<verse>You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.</verse>
<verse>"You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me.</verse>
<verse>The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long.</verse>
<verse>Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their taunts.</verse>
<verse>"You will repay them, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</verse>
<verse>You will give them dullness of heart; your curse will be on them.</verse>
<verse>You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens, O LORD."</verse>
