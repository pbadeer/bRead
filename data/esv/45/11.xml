<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="Romans" book-id="45" n="11">
<verse>I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
<verse>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?</verse>
<verse>"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."</verse>
<verse>But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</verse>
<verse>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</verse>
<verse>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
<verse>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</verse>
<verse>as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day."</verse>
<verse>And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</verse>
<verse>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever."</verse>
<verse>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.</verse>
<verse>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</verse>
<verse>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</verse>
<verse>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.</verse>
<verse>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</verse>
<verse>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
<verse>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,</verse>
<verse>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.</verse>
<verse>Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</verse>
<verse>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.</verse>
<verse>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</verse>
<verse>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.</verse>
<verse>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</verse>
<verse>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</verse>
<verse>Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
<verse>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob";</verse>
<verse>"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</verse>
<verse>As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</verse>
<verse>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
<verse>Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</verse>
<verse>so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.</verse>
<verse>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.</verse>
<verse>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</verse>
<verse>"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"</verse>
<verse>"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"</verse>
<verse>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</verse>
