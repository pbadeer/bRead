<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="2 Corinthians" book_id="47" n="2">
<verse>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.</verse>
<verse>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?</verse>
<verse>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.</verse>
<verse>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</verse>
<verse>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure--not to put it too severely--to all of you.</verse>
<verse>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,</verse>
<verse>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
<verse>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.</verse>
<verse>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
<verse>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,</verse>
<verse>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</verse>
<verse>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,</verse>
<verse>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</verse>
<verse>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.</verse>
<verse>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</verse>
<verse>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
<verse>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</verse>
