<chapter translation="ESV" testament="New" book="2 Corinthians" book-id="47" n="6">
<verse>Working together with him, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
<verse>For he says, "In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you."Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
<verse>We put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,</verse>
<verse>but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,</verse>
<verse>beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;</verse>
<verse>by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love;</verse>
<verse>by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;</verse>
<verse>through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;</verse>
<verse>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed;</verse>
<verse>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.</verse>
<verse>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open.</verse>
<verse>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.</verse>
<verse>In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also.</verse>
<verse>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</verse>
<verse>What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?</verse>
<verse>What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, "I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
<verse>Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,</verse>
<verse>and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty."</verse>
