<chapter translation="ESV" testament="Old" book="2 Chronicles" book_id="14" n="17">
<verse>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.</verse>
<verse>He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.</verse>
<verse>The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,</verse>
<verse>but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor.</verse>
<verse>His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.</verse>
<verse>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</verse>
<verse>and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.</verse>
<verse>And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.</verse>
<verse>And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
<verse>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.</verse>
<verse>And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities,</verse>
<verse>and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor;</verse>
<verse>and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;</verse>
<verse>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with 200,000 mighty men of valor.</verse>
<verse>Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield;</verse>
<verse>and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war.</verse>
<verse>These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</verse>
