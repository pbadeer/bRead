<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Exodus" book_id="2" n="20">
<verse>Then God spoke all these words, saying,</verse>
<verse>"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.</verse>
<verse>"You shall have no other gods before Me.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,</verse>
<verse>but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.</verse>
<verse>"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</verse>
<verse>"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,</verse>
<verse>but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.</verse>
<verse>"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</verse>
<verse>"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not murder.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not commit adultery.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not steal.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."</verse>
<verse>All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.</verse>
<verse>Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, or we will die."</verse>
<verse>Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin."</verse>
<verse>So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.</verse>
<verse>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.</verse>
<verse>'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.</verse>
<verse>'You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.</verse>
<verse>'If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.</verse>
<verse>'And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.'</verse>
