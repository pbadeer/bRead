<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book_id="26" n="15">
<verse>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
<verse>"Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?</verse>
<verse>"If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it then useful for anything?</verse>
<verse>"Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything!</verse>
<verse>"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</verse>
<verse>and I set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them.</verse>
<verse>'Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,'" declares the Lord GOD.</verse>
