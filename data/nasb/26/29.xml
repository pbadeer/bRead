<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book-id="26" n="29">
<verse>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</verse>
<verse>"Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, The great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, That has said, 'My Nile is mine, and I myself have made it.'</verse>
<verse>"I will put hooks in your jaws And make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. And I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, And all the fish of your rivers will cling to your scales.</verse>
<verse>"I will abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; You will fall on the open field; you will not be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky.</verse>
<verse>"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, Because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel.</verse>
<verse>"When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their hands; And when they leaned on you, You broke and made all their loins quake."</verse>
<verse>'Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon you a sword and I will cut off from you man and beast.</verse>
<verse>"The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I have made it,'</verse>
<verse>therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia.</verse>
<verse>"A man's foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years.</verse>
<verse>"So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands."</verse>
<verse>'For thus says the Lord GOD, "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.</verse>
<verse>"I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom.</verse>
<verse>"It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.</verse>
<verse>"And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."'"</verse>
<verse>Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,</verse>
<verse>"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it."</verse>
<verse>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army.</verse>
<verse>"I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor which he performed, because they acted for Me," declares the Lord GOD.</verse>
<verse>"On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth in their midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD."</verse>
