<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Ezekiel" book-id="26" n="2">
<verse>Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!"</verse>
<verse>As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me.</verse>
<verse>Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.</verse>
<verse>"I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'</verse>
<verse>"As for them, whether they listen or not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them.</verse>
<verse>"And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
<verse>"But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.</verse>
<verse>"Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."</verse>
<verse>Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll was in it.</verse>
<verse>When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe.</verse>
