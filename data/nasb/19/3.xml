<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="3">
<verse>O LORD, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me.</verse>
<verse>Many are saying of my soul, "There is no deliverance for him in God." Selah.</verse>
<verse>But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.</verse>
<verse>I was crying to the LORD with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.</verse>
<verse>I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me.</verse>
<verse>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me round about.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Salvation belongs to the LORD; Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah.</verse>
