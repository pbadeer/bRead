<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="58">
<verse>Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?</verse>
<verse>No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.</verse>
<verse>The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.</verse>
<verse>They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,</verse>
<verse>So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells.</verse>
<verse>O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>Let them flow away like water that runs off; When he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.</verse>
<verse>Let them be as a snail which melts away as it goes along, Like the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun.</verse>
<verse>Before your pots can feel the fire of thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.</verse>
<verse>The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!"</verse>
