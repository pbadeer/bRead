<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="4">
<verse>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.</verse>
<verse>O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? How long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.</verse>
<verse>But know that the LORD has set apart the godly man for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him.</verse>
<verse>Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Many are saying, "Who will show us any good?" Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O LORD!</verse>
<verse>You have put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound.</verse>
<verse>In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O LORD, make me to dwell in safety.</verse>
