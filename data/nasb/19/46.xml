<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="46">
<verse>God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.</verse>
<verse>Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change And though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea;</verse>
<verse>Though its waters roar and foam, Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah.</verse>
<verse>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling places of the Most High.</verse>
<verse>God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.</verse>
<verse>The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth melted.</verse>
<verse>The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Come, behold the works of the LORD, Who has wrought desolations in the earth.</verse>
<verse>He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.</verse>
<verse>"Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."</verse>
<verse>The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.</verse>
