<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="131">
<verse>O LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty; Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too difficult for me.</verse>
<verse>Surely I have composed and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child rests against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and forever.</verse>
