<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="114">
<verse>When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,</verse>
<verse>Judah became His sanctuary, Israel, His dominion.</verse>
<verse>The sea looked and fled; The Jordan turned back.</verse>
<verse>The mountains skipped like rams, The hills, like lambs.</verse>
<verse>What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?</verse>
<verse>O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?</verse>
<verse>Tremble, O earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.</verse>
