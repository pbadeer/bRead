<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="122">
<verse>I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."</verse>
<verse>Our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem,</verse>
<verse>Jerusalem, that is built As a city that is compact together;</verse>
<verse>To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD--An ordinance for Israel--To give thanks to the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>For there thrones were set for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.</verse>
<verse>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you.</verse>
<verse>"May peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces."</verse>
<verse>For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, "May peace be within you."</verse>
<verse>For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.</verse>
