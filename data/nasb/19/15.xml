<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="15">
<verse>O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?</verse>
<verse>He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.</verse>
<verse>He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;</verse>
<verse>In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt and does not change;</verse>
<verse>He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.</verse>
