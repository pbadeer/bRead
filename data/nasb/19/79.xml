<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="79">
<verse>O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; They have defiled Your holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.</verse>
<verse>They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.</verse>
<verse>They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them.</verse>
<verse>We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those around us.</verse>
<verse>How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?</verse>
<verse>Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name.</verse>
<verse>For they have devoured Jacob And laid waste his habitation.</verse>
<verse>Do not remember the iniquities of our forefathers against us; Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us, For we are brought very low.</verse>
<verse>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name's sake.</verse>
<verse>Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let there be known among the nations in our sight, Vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed.</verse>
<verse>Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; According to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are doomed to die.</verse>
<verse>And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom The reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.</verse>
<verse>So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture Will give thanks to You forever; To all generations we will tell of Your praise.</verse>
