<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="91">
<verse>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.</verse>
<verse>I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!"</verse>
<verse>For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper And from the deadly pestilence.</verse>
<verse>He will cover you with His pinions, And under His wings you may seek refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.</verse>
<verse>You will not be afraid of the terror by night, Or of the arrow that flies by day;</verse>
<verse>Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.</verse>
<verse>A thousand may fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand, But it shall not approach you.</verse>
<verse>You will only look on with your eyes And see the recompense of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>For you have made the LORD, my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place.</verse>
<verse>No evil will befall you, Nor will any plague come near your tent.</verse>
<verse>For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.</verse>
<verse>They will bear you up in their hands, That you do not strike your foot against a stone.</verse>
<verse>You will tread upon the lion and cobra, The young lion and the serpent you will trample down.</verse>
<verse>"Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him securely on high, because he has known My name.</verse>
<verse>"He will call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.</verse>
<verse>"With a long life I will satisfy him And let him see My salvation."</verse>
