<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="143">
<verse>Hear my prayer, O LORD, Give ear to my supplications! Answer me in Your faithfulness, in Your righteousness!</verse>
<verse>And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no man living is righteous.</verse>
<verse>For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.</verse>
<verse>Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart is appalled within me.</verse>
<verse>I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your doings; I muse on the work of Your hands.</verse>
<verse>I stretch out my hands to You; My soul longs for You, as a parched land. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Answer me quickly, O LORD, my spirit fails; Do not hide Your face from me, Or I will become like those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning; For I trust in You; Teach me the way in which I should walk; For to You I lift up my soul.</verse>
<verse>Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I take refuge in You.</verse>
<verse>Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</verse>
<verse>For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.</verse>
<verse>And in Your lovingkindness, cut off my enemies And destroy all those who afflict my soul, For I am Your servant.</verse>
