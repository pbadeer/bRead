<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="141">
<verse>O LORD, I call upon You; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to You!</verse>
<verse>May my prayer be counted as incense before You; The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.</verse>
<verse>Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.</verse>
<verse>Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice deeds of wickedness With men who do iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.</verse>
<verse>Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me; It is oil upon the head; Do not let my head refuse it, For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.</verse>
<verse>Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, And they hear my words, for they are pleasant.</verse>
<verse>As when one plows and breaks open the earth, Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.</verse>
<verse>For my eyes are toward You, O GOD, the Lord; In You I take refuge; do not leave me defenseless.</verse>
<verse>Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, And from the snares of those who do iniquity.</verse>
<verse>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I pass by safely.</verse>
