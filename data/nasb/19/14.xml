<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="14">
<verse>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God.</verse>
<verse>They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Do all the workers of wickedness not know, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call upon the Lord?</verse>
<verse>There they are in great dread, For God is with the righteous generation.</verse>
<verse>You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted, But the LORD is his refuge.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.</verse>
