<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="92">
<verse>It is good to give thanks to the LORD And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;</verse>
<verse>To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning And Your faithfulness by night,</verse>
<verse>With the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, With resounding music upon the lyre.</verse>
<verse>For You, O LORD, have made me glad by what You have done, I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.</verse>
<verse>How great are Your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep.</verse>
<verse>A senseless man has no knowledge, Nor does a stupid man understand this:</verse>
<verse>That when the wicked sprouted up like grass And all who did iniquity flourished, It was only that they might be destroyed forevermore.</verse>
<verse>But You, O LORD, are on high forever.</verse>
<verse>For, behold, Your enemies, O LORD, For, behold, Your enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered.</verse>
<verse>But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.</verse>
<verse>And my eye has looked exultantly upon my foes, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.</verse>
<verse>The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</verse>
<verse>Planted in the house of the LORD, They will flourish in the courts of our God.</verse>
<verse>They will still yield fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and very green,</verse>
<verse>To declare that the LORD is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.</verse>
