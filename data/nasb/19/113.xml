<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="113">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, Praise the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth and forever.</verse>
<verse>From the rising of the sun to its setting The name of the LORD is to be praised.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.</verse>
<verse>Who is like the LORD our God, Who is enthroned on high,</verse>
<verse>Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth?</verse>
<verse>He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the needy from the ash heap,</verse>
<verse>To make them sit with princes, With the princes of His people.</verse>
<verse>He makes the barren woman abide in the house As a joyful mother of children. Praise the LORD!</verse>
