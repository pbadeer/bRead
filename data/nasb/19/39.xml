<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="39">
<verse>I said, "I will guard my ways That I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle While the wicked are in my presence."</verse>
<verse>I was mute and silent, I refrained even from good, And my sorrow grew worse.</verse>
<verse>My heart was hot within me, While I was musing the fire burned; Then I spoke with my tongue:</verse>
<verse>"LORD, make me to know my end And what is the extent of my days; Let me know how transient I am.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight; Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"Surely every man walks about as a phantom; Surely they make an uproar for nothing; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them.</verse>
<verse>"And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.</verse>
<verse>"Deliver me from all my transgressions; Make me not the reproach of the foolish.</verse>
<verse>"I have become mute, I do not open my mouth, Because it is You who have done it.</verse>
<verse>"Remove Your plague from me; Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing.</verse>
<verse>"With reproofs You chasten a man for iniquity; You consume as a moth what is precious to him; Surely every man is a mere breath. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner like all my fathers.</verse>
<verse>"Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may smile again Before I depart and am no more."</verse>
