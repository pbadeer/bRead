<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="112">
<verse>Praise the LORD! How blessed is the man who fears the LORD, Who greatly delights in His commandments.</verse>
<verse>His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed.</verse>
<verse>Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.</verse>
<verse>Light arises in the darkness for the upright; He is gracious and compassionate and righteous.</verse>
<verse>It is well with the man who is gracious and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment.</verse>
<verse>For he will never be shaken; The righteous will be remembered forever.</verse>
<verse>He will not fear evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.</verse>
<verse>His heart is upheld, he will not fear, Until he looks with satisfaction on his adversaries.</verse>
<verse>He has given freely to the poor, His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted in honor.</verse>
<verse>The wicked will see it and be vexed, He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish.</verse>
