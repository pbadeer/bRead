<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="48">
<verse>Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain.</verse>
<verse>Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion in the far north, The city of the great King.</verse>
<verse>God, in her palaces, Has made Himself known as a stronghold.</verse>
<verse>For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.</verse>
<verse>They saw it, then they were amazed; They were terrified, they fled in alarm.</verse>
<verse>Panic seized them there, Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth.</verse>
<verse>With the east wind You break the ships of Tarshish.</verse>
<verse>As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah.</verse>
<verse>We have thought on Your lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of Your temple.</verse>
<verse>As is Your name, O God, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.</verse>
<verse>Let Mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments.</verse>
<verse>Walk about Zion and go around her; Count her towers;</verse>
<verse>Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces, That you may tell it to the next generation.</verse>
<verse>For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will guide us until death.</verse>
