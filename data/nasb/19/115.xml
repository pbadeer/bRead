<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="115">
<verse>Not to us, O LORD, not to us, But to Your name give glory Because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.</verse>
<verse>Why should the nations say, "Where, now, is their God?"</verse>
<verse>But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.</verse>
<verse>Their idols are silver and gold, The work of man's hands.</verse>
<verse>They have mouths, but they cannot speak; They have eyes, but they cannot see;</verse>
<verse>They have ears, but they cannot hear; They have noses, but they cannot smell;</verse>
<verse>They have hands, but they cannot feel; They have feet, but they cannot walk; They cannot make a sound with their throat.</verse>
<verse>Those who make them will become like them, Everyone who trusts in them.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.</verse>
<verse>He will bless those who fear the LORD, The small together with the great.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD give you increase, You and your children.</verse>
<verse>May you be blessed of the LORD, Maker of heaven and earth.</verse>
<verse>The heavens are the heavens of the LORD, But the earth He has given to the sons of men.</verse>
<verse>The dead do not praise the LORD, Nor do any who go down into silence;</verse>
<verse>But as for us, we will bless the LORD From this time forth and forever. Praise the LORD!</verse>
