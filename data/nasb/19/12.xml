<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="12">
<verse>Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases to be, For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men.</verse>
<verse>They speak falsehood to one another; With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak.</verse>
<verse>May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;</verse>
<verse>Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</verse>
<verse>"Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will set him in the safety for which he longs."</verse>
<verse>The words of the LORD are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times.</verse>
<verse>You, O LORD, will keep them; You will preserve him from this generation forever.</verse>
<verse>The wicked strut about on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.</verse>
