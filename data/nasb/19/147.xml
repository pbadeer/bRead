<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="147">
<verse>Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; For it is pleasant and praise is becoming.</verse>
<verse>The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.</verse>
<verse>He heals the brokenhearted And binds up their wounds.</verse>
<verse>He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.</verse>
<verse>Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite.</verse>
<verse>The LORD supports the afflicted; He brings down the wicked to the ground.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; Sing praises to our God on the lyre,</verse>
<verse>Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who provides rain for the earth, Who makes grass to grow on the mountains.</verse>
<verse>He gives to the beast its food, And to the young ravens which cry.</verse>
<verse>He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.</verse>
<verse>The LORD favors those who fear Him, Those who wait for His lovingkindness.</verse>
<verse>Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!</verse>
<verse>For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons within you.</verse>
<verse>He makes peace in your borders; He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat.</verse>
<verse>He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly.</verse>
<verse>He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes.</verse>
<verse>He casts forth His ice as fragments; Who can stand before His cold?</verse>
<verse>He sends forth His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow and the waters to flow.</verse>
<verse>He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.</verse>
<verse>He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His ordinances, they have not known them. Praise the LORD!</verse>
