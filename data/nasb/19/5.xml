<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="5">
<verse>Give ear to my words, O LORD, Consider my groaning.</verse>
<verse>Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray.</verse>
<verse>In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; In the morning I will order my prayer to You and eagerly watch.</verse>
<verse>For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with You.</verse>
<verse>The boastful shall not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do iniquity.</verse>
<verse>You destroy those who speak falsehood; The LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, by Your abundant lovingkindness I will enter Your house, At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my foes; Make Your way straight before me.</verse>
<verse>There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.</verse>
<verse>Hold them guilty, O God; By their own devices let them fall! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, For they are rebellious against You.</verse>
<verse>But let all who take refuge in You be glad, Let them ever sing for joy; And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may exult in You.</verse>
<verse>For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.</verse>
