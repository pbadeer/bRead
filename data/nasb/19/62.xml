<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="62">
<verse>My soul waits in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation.</verse>
<verse>He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.</verse>
<verse>How long will you assail a man, That you may murder him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</verse>
<verse>They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah.</verse>
<verse>My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from Him.</verse>
<verse>He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>On God my salvation and my glory rest; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.</verse>
<verse>Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Men of low degree are only vanity and men of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up; They are together lighter than breath.</verse>
<verse>Do not trust in oppression And do not vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.</verse>
<verse>Once God has spoken; Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God;</verse>
<verse>And lovingkindness is Yours, O Lord, For You recompense a man according to his work.</verse>
