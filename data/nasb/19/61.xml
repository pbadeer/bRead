<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="61">
<verse>Hear my cry, O God; Give heed to my prayer.</verse>
<verse>From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</verse>
<verse>For You have been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy.</verse>
<verse>Let me dwell in Your tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.</verse>
<verse>For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name.</verse>
<verse>You will prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations.</verse>
<verse>He will abide before God forever; Appoint lovingkindness and truth that they may preserve him.</verse>
<verse>So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day.</verse>
