<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="125">
<verse>Those who trust in the LORD Are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever.</verse>
<verse>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the LORD surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.</verse>
<verse>For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the righteous, So that the righteous will not put forth their hands to do wrong.</verse>
<verse>Do good, O LORD, to those who are good And to those who are upright in their hearts.</verse>
<verse>But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, The LORD will lead them away with the doers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.</verse>
