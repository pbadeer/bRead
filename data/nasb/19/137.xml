<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="137">
<verse>By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down and wept, When we remembered Zion.</verse>
<verse>Upon the willows in the midst of it We hung our harps.</verse>
<verse>For there our captors demanded of us songs, And our tormentors mirth, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."</verse>
<verse>How can we sing the LORD'S song In a foreign land?</verse>
<verse>If I forget you, O Jerusalem, May my right hand forget her skill.</verse>
<verse>May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.</verse>
<verse>Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it To its very foundation."</verse>
<verse>O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid us.</verse>
<verse>How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock.</verse>
