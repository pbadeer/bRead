<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="140">
<verse>Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men</verse>
<verse>Who devise evil things in their hearts; They continually stir up wars.</verse>
<verse>They sharpen their tongues as a serpent; Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men Who have purposed to trip up my feet.</verse>
<verse>The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.</verse>
<verse>I said to the LORD, "You are my God; Give ear, O LORD, to the voice of my supplications.</verse>
<verse>"O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.</verse>
<verse>"Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; Do not promote his evil device, that they not be exalted. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"As for the head of those who surround me, May the mischief of their lips cover them.</verse>
<verse>"May burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, Into deep pits from which they cannot rise.</verse>
<verse>"May a slanderer not be established in the earth; May evil hunt the violent man speedily."</verse>
<verse>I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted And justice for the poor.</verse>
<verse>Surely the righteous will give thanks to Your name; The upright will dwell in Your presence.</verse>
