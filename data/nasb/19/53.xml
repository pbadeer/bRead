<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="53">
<verse>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God," They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good.</verse>
<verse>God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God.</verse>
<verse>Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.</verse>
<verse>Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up My people as though they ate bread And have not called upon God?</verse>
<verse>There they were in great fear where no fear had been; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you; You put them to shame, because God had rejected them.</verse>
<verse>Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His captive people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad</verse>
