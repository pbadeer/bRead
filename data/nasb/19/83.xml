<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="83">
<verse>O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.</verse>
<verse>For behold, Your enemies make an uproar, And those who hate You have exalted themselves.</verse>
<verse>They make shrewd plans against Your people, And conspire together against Your treasured ones.</verse>
<verse>They have said, "Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation, That the name of Israel be remembered no more."</verse>
<verse>For they have conspired together with one mind; Against You they make a covenant:</verse>
<verse>The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;</verse>
<verse>Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;</verse>
<verse>Assyria also has joined with them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera and Jabin at the torrent of Kishon,</verse>
<verse>Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became as dung for the ground.</verse>
<verse>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,</verse>
<verse>Who said, "Let us possess for ourselves The pastures of God."</verse>
<verse>O my God, make them like the whirling dust, Like chaff before the wind.</verse>
<verse>Like fire that burns the forest And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,</verse>
<verse>So pursue them with Your tempest And terrify them with Your storm.</verse>
<verse>Fill their faces with dishonor, That they may seek Your name, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever, And let them be humiliated and perish,</verse>
<verse>That they may know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, Are the Most High over all the earth.</verse>
