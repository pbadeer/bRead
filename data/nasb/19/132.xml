<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="132">
<verse>Remember, O LORD, on David's behalf, All his affliction;</verse>
<verse>How he swore to the LORD And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,</verse>
<verse>"Surely I will not enter my house, Nor lie on my bed;</verse>
<verse>I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids,</verse>
<verse>Until I find a place for the LORD, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."</verse>
<verse>Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah, We found it in the field of Jaar.</verse>
<verse>Let us go into His dwelling place; Let us worship at His footstool.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.</verse>
<verse>Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your godly ones sing for joy.</verse>
<verse>For the sake of David Your servant, Do not turn away the face of Your anointed.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has sworn to David A truth from which He will not turn back: "Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.</verse>
<verse>"If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I will teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forever."</verse>
<verse>For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.</verse>
<verse>"This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</verse>
<verse>"I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy with bread.</verse>
<verse>"Her priests also I will clothe with salvation, And her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.</verse>
<verse>"There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.</verse>
<verse>"His enemies I will clothe with shame, But upon himself his crown shall shine."</verse>
