<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="60">
<verse>O God, You have rejected us. You have broken us; You have been angry; O, restore us.</verse>
<verse>You have made the land quake, You have split it open; Heal its breaches, for it totters.</verse>
<verse>You have made Your people experience hardship; You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.</verse>
<verse>You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</verse>
<verse>That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer us!</verse>
<verse>God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>"Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.</verse>
<verse>"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!"</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?</verse>
<verse>O give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.</verse>
<verse>Through God we shall do valiantly, And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.</verse>
