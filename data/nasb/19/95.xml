<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="95">
<verse>O come, let us sing for joy to the LORD, Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD is a great God And a great King above all gods,</verse>
<verse>In whose hand are the depths of the earth, The peaks of the mountains are His also.</verse>
<verse>The sea is His, for it was He who made it, And His hands formed the dry land.</verse>
<verse>Come, let us worship and bow down, Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.</verse>
<verse>For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice,</verse>
<verse>Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,</verse>
<verse>"When your fathers tested Me, They tried Me, though they had seen My work.</verse>
<verse>"For forty years I loathed that generation, And said they are a people who err in their heart, And they do not know My ways.</verse>
<verse>"Therefore I swore in My anger, Truly they shall not enter into My rest."</verse>
