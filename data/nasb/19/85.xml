<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="85">
<verse>O LORD, You showed favor to Your land; You restored the captivity of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah.</verse>
<verse>You withdrew all Your fury; You turned away from Your burning anger.</verse>
<verse>Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.</verse>
<verse>Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?</verse>
<verse>Will You not Yourself revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You?</verse>
<verse>Show us Your lovingkindness, O LORD, And grant us Your salvation.</verse>
<verse>I will hear what God the LORD will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; But let them not turn back to folly.</verse>
<verse>Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.</verse>
<verse>Lovingkindness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</verse>
<verse>Truth springs from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven.</verse>
<verse>Indeed, the LORD will give what is good, And our land will yield its produce.</verse>
<verse>Righteousness will go before Him And will make His footsteps into a way.</verse>
