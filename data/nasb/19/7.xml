<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="7">
<verse>O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</verse>
<verse>Or he will tear my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is none to deliver.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands,</verse>
<verse>If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary,</verse>
<verse>Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; And let him trample my life down to the ground And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And arouse Yourself for me; You have appointed judgment.</verse>
<verse>Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You, And over them return on high.</verse>
<verse>The LORD judges the peoples; Vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me.</verse>
<verse>O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.</verse>
<verse>My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day.</verse>
<verse>If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.</verse>
<verse>He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.</verse>
<verse>Behold, he travails with wickedness, And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.</verse>
<verse>He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made.</verse>
<verse>His mischief will return upon his own head, And his violence will descend upon his own pate.</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</verse>
