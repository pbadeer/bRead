<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="1">
<verse>How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!</verse>
<verse>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.</verse>
<verse>He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.</verse>
<verse>The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish.</verse>
