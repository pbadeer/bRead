<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="93">
<verse>The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.</verse>
<verse>Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.</verse>
<verse>The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice, The floods lift up their pounding waves.</verse>
<verse>More than the sounds of many waters, Than the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty.</verse>
<verse>Your testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness befits Your house, O LORD, forevermore.</verse>
