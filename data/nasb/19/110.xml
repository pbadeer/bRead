<verse>The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."</verse>
<verse>The LORD will stretch forth Your strong scepter from Zion, saying, "Rule in the midst of Your enemies."</verse>
<verse>Your people will volunteer freely in the day of Your power; In holy array, from the womb of the dawn, Your youth are to You as the dew.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
<verse>The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.</verse>
<verse>He will judge among the nations, He will fill them with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country.</verse>
<verse>He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up His head.</verse>
