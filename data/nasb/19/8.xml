<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="8">
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!</verse>
<verse>From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.</verse>
<verse>When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;</verse>
<verse>What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him?</verse>
<verse>Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty!</verse>
<verse>You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,</verse>
<verse>All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,</verse>
<verse>The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth!</verse>
