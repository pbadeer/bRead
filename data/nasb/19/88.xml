<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="88">
<verse>O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried out by day and in the night before You.</verse>
<verse>Let my prayer come before You; Incline Your ear to my cry!</verse>
<verse>For my soul has had enough troubles, And my life has drawn near to Sheol.</verse>
<verse>I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit; I have become like a man without strength,</verse>
<verse>Forsaken among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom You remember no more, And they are cut off from Your hand.</verse>
<verse>You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.</verse>
<verse>Your wrath has rested upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.</verse>
<verse>You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an object of loathing to them; I am shut up and cannot go out.</verse>
<verse>My eye has wasted away because of affliction; I have called upon You every day, O LORD; I have spread out my hands to You.</verse>
<verse>Will You perform wonders for the dead? Will the departed spirits rise and praise You? Selah.</verse>
<verse>Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?</verse>
<verse>Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</verse>
<verse>But I, O LORD, have cried out to You for help, And in the morning my prayer comes before You.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, why do You reject my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me?</verse>
<verse>I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on; I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome.</verse>
<verse>Your burning anger has passed over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.</verse>
<verse>They have surrounded me like water all day long; They have encompassed me altogether.</verse>
<verse>You have removed lover and friend far from me; My acquaintances are in darkness.</verse>
