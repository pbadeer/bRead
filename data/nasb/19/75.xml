<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="75">
<verse>We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks, For Your name is near; Men declare Your wondrous works.</verse>
<verse>"When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity.</verse>
<verse>"The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn;</verse>
<verse>Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.'"</verse>
<verse>For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert comes exaltation;</verse>
<verse>But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.</verse>
<verse>For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</verse>
