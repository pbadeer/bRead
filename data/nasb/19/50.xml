<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="50">
<verse>The Mighty One, God, the LORD, has spoken, And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.</verse>
<verse>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.</verse>
<verse>May our God come and not keep silence; Fire devours before Him, And it is very tempestuous around Him.</verse>
<verse>He summons the heavens above, And the earth, to judge His people:</verse>
<verse>"Gather My godly ones to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."</verse>
<verse>And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is judge. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you; I am God, your God.</verse>
<verse>"I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, And your burnt offerings are continually before Me.</verse>
<verse>"I shall take no young bull out of your house Nor male goats out of your folds.</verse>
<verse>"For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.</verse>
<verse>"I know every bird of the mountains, And everything that moves in the field is Mine.</verse>
<verse>"If I were hungry I would not tell you, For the world is Mine, and all it contains.</verse>
<verse>"Shall I eat the flesh of bulls Or drink the blood of male goats?</verse>
<verse>"Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving And pay your vows to the Most High;</verse>
<verse>Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me."</verse>
<verse>But to the wicked God says, "What right have you to tell of My statutes And to take My covenant in your mouth?</verse>
<verse>"For you hate discipline, And you cast My words behind you.</verse>
<verse>"When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, And you associate with adulterers.</verse>
<verse>"You let your mouth loose in evil And your tongue frames deceit.</verse>
<verse>"You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son.</verse>
<verse>"These things you have done and I kept silence; You thought that I was just like you; I will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes.</verse>
<verse>"Now consider this, you who forget God, Or I will tear you in pieces, and there will be none to deliver.</verse>
<verse>"He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; And to him who orders his way aright I shall show the salvation of God."</verse>
