<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="6">
<verse>O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your wrath.</verse>
<verse>Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed.</verse>
<verse>And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD--how long?</verse>
<verse>Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your lovingkindness.</verse>
<verse>For there is no mention of You in death; In Sheol who will give You thanks?</verse>
<verse>I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears.</verse>
<verse>My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries.</verse>
<verse>Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
<verse>The LORD has heard my supplication, The LORD receives my prayer.</verse>
<verse>All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they will suddenly be ashamed.</verse>
