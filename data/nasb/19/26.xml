<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="26">
<verse>Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, And I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</verse>
<verse>Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my heart.</verse>
<verse>For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.</verse>
<verse>I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with pretenders.</verse>
<verse>I hate the assembly of evildoers, And I will not sit with the wicked.</verse>
<verse>I shall wash my hands in innocence, And I will go about Your altar, O LORD,</verse>
<verse>That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving And declare all Your wonders.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, I love the habitation of Your house And the place where Your glory dwells.</verse>
<verse>Do not take my soul away along with sinners, Nor my life with men of bloodshed,</verse>
<verse>In whose hands is a wicked scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.</verse>
<verse>But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious to me.</verse>
<verse>My foot stands on a level place; In the congregations I shall bless the LORD.</verse>
