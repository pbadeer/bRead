<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="149">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, And His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.</verse>
<verse>Let Israel be glad in his Maker; Let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise His name with dancing; Let them sing praises to Him with timbrel and lyre.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the afflicted ones with salvation.</verse>
<verse>Let the godly ones exult in glory; Let them sing for joy on their beds.</verse>
<verse>Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,</verse>
<verse>To execute vengeance on the nations And punishment on the peoples,</verse>
<verse>To bind their kings with chains And their nobles with fetters of iron,</verse>
<verse>To execute on them the judgment written; This is an honor for all His godly ones. Praise the LORD!</verse>
