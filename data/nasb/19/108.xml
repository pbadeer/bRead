<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="108">
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.</verse>
<verse>Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the peoples, And I will sing praises to You among the nations.</verse>
<verse>For Your lovingkindness is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the skies.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Your glory above all the earth.</verse>
<verse>That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer me!</verse>
<verse>God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem And measure out the valley of Succoth.</verse>
<verse>"Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.</verse>
<verse>"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Over Philistia I will shout aloud."</verse>
<verse>Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?</verse>
<verse>Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?</verse>
<verse>Oh give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.</verse>
<verse>Through God we will do valiantly, And it is He who shall tread down our adversaries.</verse>
