<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="84">
<verse>How lovely are Your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!</verse>
<verse>My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.</verse>
<verse>The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even Your altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God.</verse>
<verse>How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah.</verse>
<verse>How blessed is the man whose strength is in You, In whose heart are the highways to Zion!</verse>
<verse>Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a spring; The early rain also covers it with blessings.</verse>
<verse>They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appears before God in Zion.</verse>
<verse>O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah.</verse>
<verse>Behold our shield, O God, And look upon the face of Your anointed.</verse>
<verse>For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand outside. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly.</verse>
<verse>O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in You!</verse>
