<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="144">
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my hands for war, And my fingers for battle;</verse>
<verse>My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You think of him?</verse>
<verse>Man is like a mere breath; His days are like a passing shadow.</verse>
<verse>Bow Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.</verse>
<verse>Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Your arrows and confuse them.</verse>
<verse>Stretch forth Your hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens</verse>
<verse>Whose mouths speak deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</verse>
<verse>I will sing a new song to You, O God; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,</verse>
<verse>Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.</verse>
<verse>Rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</verse>
<verse>Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants, And our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace;</verse>
<verse>Let our garners be full, furnishing every kind of produce, And our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;</verse>
<verse>Let our cattle bear Without mishap and without loss, Let there be no outcry in our streets!</verse>
<verse>How blessed are the people who are so situated; How blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!</verse>
