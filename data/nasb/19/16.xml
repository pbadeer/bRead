<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="16">
<verse>Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.</verse>
<verse>I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good besides You."</verse>
<verse>As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight.</verse>
<verse>The sorrows of those who have bartered for another god will be multiplied; I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.</verse>
<verse>The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.</verse>
<verse>I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.</verse>
<verse>I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.</verse>
<verse>For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.</verse>
<verse>You will make known to me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.</verse>
