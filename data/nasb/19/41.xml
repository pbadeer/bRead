<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="41">
<verse>How blessed is he who considers the helpless; The LORD will deliver him in a day of trouble.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will protect him and keep him alive, And he shall be called blessed upon the earth; And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will sustain him upon his sickbed; In his illness, You restore him to health.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."</verse>
<verse>My enemies speak evil against me, "When will he die, and his name perish?"</verse>
<verse>And when he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; When he goes outside, he tells it.</verse>
<verse>All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt, saying,</verse>
<verse>"A wicked thing is poured out upon him, That when he lies down, he will not rise up again."</verse>
<verse>Even my close friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.</verse>
<verse>But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, That I may repay them.</verse>
<verse>By this I know that You are pleased with me, Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.</verse>
<verse>As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, And You set me in Your presence forever.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.</verse>
