<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="30">
<verse>I will extol You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Sing praise to the LORD, you His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy name.</verse>
<verse>For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the morning.</verse>
<verse>Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, "I will never be moved."</verse>
<verse>O LORD, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, I was dismayed.</verse>
<verse>To You, O LORD, I called, And to the Lord I made supplication:</verse>
<verse>"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness?</verse>
<verse>"Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me; O LORD, be my helper."</verse>
<verse>You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,</verse>
<verse>That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever.</verse>
