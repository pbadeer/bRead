<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="36">
<verse>Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.</verse>
<verse>For it flatters him in his own eyes Concerning the discovery of his iniquity and the hatred of it.</verse>
<verse>The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good.</verse>
<verse>He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil.</verse>
<verse>Your lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</verse>
<verse>Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are like a great deep. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.</verse>
<verse>How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.</verse>
<verse>They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house; And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights.</verse>
<verse>For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light.</verse>
<verse>O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.</verse>
<verse>There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise.</verse>
