<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="116">
<verse>I love the LORD, because He hears My voice and my supplications.</verse>
<verse>Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I shall call upon Him as long as I live.</verse>
<verse>The cords of death encompassed me And the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.</verse>
<verse>Then I called upon the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I beseech You, save my life!"</verse>
<verse>Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yes, our God is compassionate.</verse>
<verse>The LORD preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.</verse>
<verse>Return to your rest, O my soul, For the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.</verse>
<verse>For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from stumbling.</verse>
<verse>I shall walk before the LORD In the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>I believed when I said, "I am greatly afflicted."</verse>
<verse>I said in my alarm, "All men are liars."</verse>
<verse>What shall I render to the LORD For all His benefits toward me?</verse>
<verse>I shall lift up the cup of salvation And call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I shall pay my vows to the LORD, Oh may it be in the presence of all His people.</verse>
<verse>Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His godly ones.</verse>
<verse>O LORD, surely I am Your servant, I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid, You have loosed my bonds.</verse>
<verse>To You I shall offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I shall pay my vows to the LORD, Oh may it be in the presence of all His people,</verse>
<verse>In the courts of the LORD'S house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!</verse>
