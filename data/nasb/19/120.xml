<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="120">
<verse>In my trouble I cried to the LORD, And He answered me.</verse>
<verse>Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue.</verse>
<verse>What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, You deceitful tongue?</verse>
<verse>Sharp arrows of the warrior, With the burning coals of the broom tree.</verse>
<verse>Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech, For I dwell among the tents of Kedar!</verse>
<verse>Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace.</verse>
<verse>I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war.</verse>
