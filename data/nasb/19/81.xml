<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="81">
<verse>Sing for joy to God our strength; Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Raise a song, strike the timbrel, The sweet sounding lyre with the harp.</verse>
<verse>Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast day.</verse>
<verse>For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>He established it for a testimony in Joseph When he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not know:</verse>
<verse>"I relieved his shoulder of the burden, His hands were freed from the basket.</verse>
<verse>"You called in trouble and I rescued you; I answered you in the hiding place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would listen to Me!</verse>
<verse>"Let there be no strange god among you; Nor shall you worship any foreign god.</verse>
<verse>"I, the LORD, am your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.</verse>
<verse>"But My people did not listen to My voice, And Israel did not obey Me.</verse>
<verse>"So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart, To walk in their own devices.</verse>
<verse>"Oh that My people would listen to Me, That Israel would walk in My ways!</verse>
<verse>"I would quickly subdue their enemies And turn My hand against their adversaries.</verse>
<verse>"Those who hate the LORD would pretend obedience to Him, And their time of punishment would be forever.</verse>
<verse>"But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."</verse>
