<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="27">
<verse>The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; Whom shall I dread?</verse>
<verse>When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.</verse>
<verse>Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear; Though war arise against me, In spite of this I shall be confident.</verse>
<verse>One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD And to meditate in His temple.</verse>
<verse>For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me; He will lift me up on a rock.</verse>
<verse>And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me, And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, And be gracious to me and answer me.</verse>
<verse>When You said, "Seek My face," my heart said to You, "Your face, O LORD, I shall seek."</verse>
<verse>Do not hide Your face from me, Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not abandon me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation!</verse>
<verse>For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the LORD will take me up.</verse>
<verse>Teach me Your way, O LORD, And lead me in a level path Because of my foes.</verse>
<verse>Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence.</verse>
<verse>I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>Wait for the LORD; Be strong and let your heart take courage; Yes, wait for the LORD.</verse>
