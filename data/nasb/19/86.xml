<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="86">
<verse>Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me; For I am afflicted and needy.</verse>
<verse>Preserve my soul, for I am a godly man; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.</verse>
<verse>Be gracious to me, O Lord, For to You I cry all day long.</verse>
<verse>Make glad the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</verse>
<verse>For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.</verse>
<verse>Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And give heed to the voice of my supplications!</verse>
<verse>In the day of my trouble I shall call upon You, For You will answer me.</verse>
<verse>There is no one like You among the gods, O Lord, Nor are there any works like Yours.</verse>
<verse>All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And they shall glorify Your name.</verse>
<verse>For You are great and do wondrous deeds; You alone are God.</verse>
<verse>Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And will glorify Your name forever.</verse>
<verse>For Your lovingkindness toward me is great, And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.</verse>
<verse>O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a band of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set You before them.</verse>
<verse>But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.</verse>
<verse>Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Oh grant Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your handmaid.</verse>
<verse>Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</verse>
