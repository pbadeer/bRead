<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="43">
<verse>Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!</verse>
<verse>For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</verse>
<verse>O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.</verse>
<verse>Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise You, O God, my God.</verse>
<verse>Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.</verse>
