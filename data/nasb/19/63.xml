<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="63">
<verse>O God, You are my God; I shall seek You earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is no water.</verse>
<verse>Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory.</verse>
<verse>Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips will praise You.</verse>
<verse>So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.</verse>
<verse>My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.</verse>
<verse>When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches,</verse>
<verse>For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.</verse>
<verse>My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.</verse>
<verse>But those who seek my life to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth.</verse>
<verse>They will be delivered over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes.</verse>
<verse>But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will glory, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.</verse>
