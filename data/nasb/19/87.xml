<verse>His foundation is in the holy mountains.</verse>
<verse>The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the other dwelling places of Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.</verse>
<verse>"I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.'"</verse>
<verse>But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.</verse>
<verse>Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes shall say, "All my springs of joy are in you."</verse>
