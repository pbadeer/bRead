<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="96">
<verse>Sing to the LORD a new song; Sing to the LORD, all the earth.</verse>
<verse>Sing to the LORD, bless His name; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day.</verse>
<verse>Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.</verse>
<verse>For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.</verse>
<verse>For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens.</verse>
<verse>Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.</verse>
<verse>Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; Bring an offering and come into His courts.</verse>
<verse>Worship the LORD in holy attire; Tremble before Him, all the earth.</verse>
<verse>Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity."</verse>
<verse>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and all it contains;</verse>
<verse>Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy</verse>
<verse>Before the LORD, for He is coming, For He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness And the peoples in His faithfulness.</verse>
