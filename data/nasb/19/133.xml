<verse>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity!</verse>
<verse>It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron's beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes.</verse>
<verse>It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the LORD commanded the blessing--life forever.</verse>
