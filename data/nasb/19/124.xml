<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="124">
<verse>"Had it not been the LORD who was on our side," Let Israel now say,</verse>
<verse>"Had it not been the LORD who was on our side When men rose up against us,</verse>
<verse>Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their anger was kindled against us;</verse>
<verse>Then the waters would have engulfed us, The stream would have swept over our soul;</verse>
<verse>Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul."</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth.</verse>
<verse>Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper; The snare is broken and we have escaped.</verse>
<verse>Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.</verse>
