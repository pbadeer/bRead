<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="52">
<verse>Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endures all day long.</verse>
<verse>Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit.</verse>
<verse>You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.</verse>
<verse>You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.</verse>
<verse>But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.</verse>
<verse>The righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, saying,</verse>
<verse>"Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches And was strong in his evil desire."</verse>
<verse>But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>I will give You thanks forever, because You have done it, And I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones.</verse>
