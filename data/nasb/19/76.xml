<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="76">
<verse>God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.</verse>
<verse>His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion.</verse>
<verse>There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. Selah.</verse>
<verse>You are resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey.</verse>
<verse>The stouthearted were plundered, They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands.</verse>
<verse>At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.</verse>
<verse>You, even You, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?</verse>
<verse>You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still</verse>
<verse>When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.</verse>
<verse>For the wrath of man shall praise You; With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself.</verse>
<verse>Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.</verse>
<verse>He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.</verse>
