<verse>The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; The God of glory thunders, The LORD is over many waters.</verse>
<verse>The voice of the LORD is powerful, The voice of the LORD is majestic.</verse>
<verse>The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; Yes, the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>

<verse>The voice of the LORD hews out flames of fire.</verse>
<verse>The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</verse>
<verse>The voice of the LORD makes the deer to calve And strips the forests bare; And in His temple everything says, "Glory!"</verse>
