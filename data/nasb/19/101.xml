<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="101">
<verse>I will sing of lovingkindness and justice, To You, O LORD, I will sing praises.</verse>
<verse>I will give heed to the blameless way. When will You come to me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.</verse>
<verse>I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not fasten its grip on me.</verse>
<verse>A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil.</verse>
<verse>Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.</verse>
<verse>My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He who walks in a blameless way is the one who will minister to me.</verse>
<verse>He who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me.</verse>
<verse>Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, So as to cut off from the city of the LORD all those who do iniquity.</verse>
