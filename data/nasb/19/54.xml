<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="54">
<verse>. Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power.</verse>
<verse>Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.</verse>
<verse>For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.</verse>
<verse>He will recompense the evil to my foes; Destroy them in Your faithfulness.</verse>
<verse>Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good.</verse>
<verse>For He has delivered me from all trouble, And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies.</verse>
