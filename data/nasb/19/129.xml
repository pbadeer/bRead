<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="129">
<verse>"Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up," Let Israel now say,</verse>
<verse>"Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up; Yet they have not prevailed against me.</verse>
<verse>"The plowers plowed upon my back; They lengthened their furrows."</verse>
<verse>The LORD is righteous; He has cut in two the cords of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>May all who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned backward;</verse>
<verse>Let them be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;</verse>
<verse>With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Or the binder of sheaves his bosom;</verse>
<verse>Nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD."</verse>
