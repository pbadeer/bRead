<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="47">
<verse>O clap your hands, all peoples; Shout to God with the voice of joy.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD Most High is to be feared, A great King over all the earth.</verse>
<verse>He subdues peoples under us And nations under our feet.</verse>
<verse>He chooses our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom He loves. Selah.</verse>
<verse>God has ascended with a shout, The LORD, with the sound of a trumpet.</verse>
<verse>Sing praises to God, sing praises; Sing praises to our King, sing praises.</verse>
<verse>For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with a skillful psalm.</verse>
<verse>God reigns over the nations, God sits on His holy throne.</verse>
<verse>The princes of the people have assembled themselves as the people of the God of Abraham, For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.</verse>
