<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="64">
<verse>Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.</verse>
<verse>Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity,</verse>
<verse>Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech as their arrow,</verse>
<verse>To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.</verse>
<verse>They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?"</verse>
<verse>They devise injustices, saying, "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.</verse>
<verse>But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.</verse>
<verse>So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head.</verse>
<verse>Then all men will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.</verse>
<verse>The righteous man will be glad in the LORD and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory.</verse>
