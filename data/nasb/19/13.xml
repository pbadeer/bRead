<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="13">
<verse>How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?</verse>
<verse>How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?</verse>
<verse>Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,</verse>
<verse>And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken.</verse>
<verse>But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.</verse>
<verse>I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.</verse>
