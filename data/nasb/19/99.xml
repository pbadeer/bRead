<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="99">
<verse>The LORD reigns, let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned above the cherubim, let the earth shake!</verse>
<verse>The LORD is great in Zion, And He is exalted above all the peoples.</verse>
<verse>Let them praise Your great and awesome name; Holy is He.</verse>
<verse>The strength of the King loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.</verse>
<verse>Exalt the LORD our God And worship at His footstool; Holy is He.</verse>
<verse>Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called on His name; They called upon the LORD and He answered them.</verse>
<verse>He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; They kept His testimonies And the statute that He gave them.</verse>
<verse>O LORD our God, You answered them; You were a forgiving God to them, And yet an avenger of their evil deeds.</verse>
<verse>Exalt the LORD our God And worship at His holy hill, For holy is the LORD our God.</verse>
