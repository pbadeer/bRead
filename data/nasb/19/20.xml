<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="20">
<verse>May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high!</verse>
<verse>May He send you help from the sanctuary And support you from Zion!</verse>
<verse>May He remember all your meal offerings And find your burnt offering acceptable! Selah.</verse>
<verse>May He grant you your heart's desire And fulfill all your counsel!</verse>
<verse>We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.</verse>
<verse>Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand.</verse>
<verse>Some boast in chariots and some in horses, But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.</verse>
<verse>They have bowed down and fallen, But we have risen and stood upright.</verse>
<verse>Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.</verse>
