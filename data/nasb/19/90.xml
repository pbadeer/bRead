<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="90">
<verse>Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.</verse>
<verse>Before the mountains were born Or You gave birth to the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.</verse>
<verse>You turn man back into dust And say, "Return, O children of men."</verse>
<verse>For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday when it passes by, Or as a watch in the night.</verse>
<verse>You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep; In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew.</verse>
<verse>In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew; Toward evening it fades and withers away.</verse>
<verse>For we have been consumed by Your anger And by Your wrath we have been dismayed.</verse>
<verse>You have placed our iniquities before You, Our secret sins in the light of Your presence.</verse>
<verse>For all our days have declined in Your fury; We have finished our years like a sigh.</verse>
<verse>As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow; For soon it is gone and we fly away.</verse>
<verse>Who understands the power of Your anger And Your fury, according to the fear that is due You?</verse>
<verse>So teach us to number our days, That we may present to You a heart of wisdom.</verse>
<verse>Do return, O LORD; how long will it be? And be sorry for Your servants.</verse>
<verse>O satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness, That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</verse>
<verse>Make us glad according to the days You have afflicted us, And the years we have seen evil.</verse>
<verse>Let Your work appear to Your servants And Your majesty to their children.</verse>
<verse>Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And confirm for us the work of our hands; Yes, confirm the work of our hands.</verse>
