<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="28">
<verse>To You, O LORD, I call; My rock, do not be deaf to me, For if You are silent to me, I will become like those who go down to the pit.</verse>
<verse>Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to You for help, When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.</verse>
<verse>Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who work iniquity, Who speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts.</verse>
<verse>Requite them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands; Repay them their recompense.</verse>
<verse>Because they do not regard the works of the LORD Nor the deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up.</verse>
<verse>Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplication.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank Him.</verse>
<verse>The LORD is their strength, And He is a saving defense to His anointed.</verse>
<verse>Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; Be their shepherd also, and carry them forever.</verse>
