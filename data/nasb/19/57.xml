<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="57">
<verse>Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.</verse>
<verse>I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me.</verse>
<verse>He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth.</verse>
<verse>My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth.</verse>
<verse>They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. Selah.</verse>
<verse>My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!</verse>
<verse>Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.</verse>
<verse>I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.</verse>
<verse>For Your lovingkindness is great to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth.</verse>
