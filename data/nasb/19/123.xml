<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="123">
<verse>To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens!</verse>
<verse>Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the LORD our God, Until He is gracious to us.</verse>
<verse>Be gracious to us, O LORD, be gracious to us, For we are greatly filled with contempt.</verse>
<verse>Our soul is greatly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.</verse>
