<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="146">
<verse>Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!</verse>
<verse>I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.</verse>
<verse>Do not trust in princes, In mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.</verse>
<verse>His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.</verse>
<verse>How blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the LORD his God,</verse>
<verse>Who made heaven and earth, The sea and all that is in them; Who keeps faith forever;</verse>
<verse>Who executes justice for the oppressed; Who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free.</verse>
<verse>The LORD opens the eyes of the blind; The LORD raises up those who are bowed down; The LORD loves the righteous;</verse>
<verse>The LORD protects the strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow, But He thwarts the way of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will reign forever, Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!</verse>
