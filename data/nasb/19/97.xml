<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="97">
<verse>The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; Let the many islands be glad.</verse>
<verse>Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.</verse>
<verse>Fire goes before Him And burns up His adversaries round about.</verse>
<verse>His lightnings lit up the world; The earth saw and trembled.</verse>
<verse>The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
<verse>The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His glory.</verse>
<verse>Let all those be ashamed who serve graven images, Who boast themselves of idols; Worship Him, all you gods.</verse>
<verse>Zion heard this and was glad, And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced Because of Your judgments, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>For You are the LORD Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.</verse>
<verse>Hate evil, you who love the LORD, Who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>Light is sown like seed for the righteous And gladness for the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>Be glad in the LORD, you righteous ones, And give thanks to His holy name.</verse>
