<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="138">
<verse>I will give You thanks with all my heart; I will sing praises to You before the gods.</verse>
<verse>I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word according to all Your name.</verse>
<verse>On the day I called, You answered me; You made me bold with strength in my soul.</verse>
<verse>All the kings of the earth will give thanks to You, O LORD, When they have heard the words of Your mouth.</verse>
<verse>And they will sing of the ways of the LORD, For great is the glory of the LORD.</verse>
<verse>For though the LORD is exalted, Yet He regards the lowly, But the haughty He knows from afar.</verse>
<verse>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand will save me.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will accomplish what concerns me; Your lovingkindness, O LORD, is everlasting; Do not forsake the works of Your hands.</verse>
