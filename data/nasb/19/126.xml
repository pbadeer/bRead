<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="126">
<verse>When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, We were like those who dream.</verse>
<verse>Then our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."</verse>
<verse>The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad.</verse>
<verse>Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South.</verse>
<verse>Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.</verse>
<verse>He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed, Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.</verse>
