<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="42">
<verse>As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, O God.</verse>
<verse>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God?</verse>
<verse>My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God, With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.</verse>
<verse>Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him For the help of His presence.</verse>
<verse>O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.</verse>
<verse>Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.</verse>
<verse>The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.</verse>
<verse>I will say to God my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"</verse>
<verse>As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</verse>
<verse>Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.</verse>
