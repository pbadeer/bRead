<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="17">
<verse>Hear a just cause, O LORD, give heed to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.</verse>
<verse>Let my judgment come forth from Your presence; Let Your eyes look with equity.</verse>
<verse>You have tried my heart; You have visited me by night; You have tested me and You find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.</verse>
<verse>As for the deeds of men, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the paths of the violent.</verse>
<verse>My steps have held fast to Your paths. My feet have not slipped.</verse>
<verse>I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.</verse>
<verse>Wondrously show Your lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Your right hand From those who rise up against them.</verse>
<verse>Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings</verse>
<verse>From the wicked who despoil me, My deadly enemies who surround me.</verse>
<verse>They have closed their unfeeling heart, With their mouth they speak proudly.</verse>
<verse>They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the ground.</verse>
<verse>He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in hiding places.</verse>
<verse>Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword,</verse>
<verse>From men with Your hand, O LORD, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly You fill with Your treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babes.</verse>
<verse>As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake.</verse>
