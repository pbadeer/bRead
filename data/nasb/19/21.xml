<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="21">
<verse>O LORD, in Your strength the king will be glad, And in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!</verse>
<verse>You have given him his heart's desire, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.</verse>
<verse>For You meet him with the blessings of good things; You set a crown of fine gold on his head.</verse>
<verse>He asked life of You, You gave it to him, Length of days forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>His glory is great through Your salvation, Splendor and majesty You place upon him.</verse>
<verse>For You make him most blessed forever; You make him joyful with gladness in Your presence.</verse>
<verse>For the king trusts in the LORD, And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken.</verse>
<verse>Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you.</verse>
<verse>You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them.</verse>
<verse>Their offspring You will destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men.</verse>
<verse>Though they intended evil against You And devised a plot, They will not succeed.</verse>
<verse>For You will make them turn their back; You will aim with Your bowstrings at their faces.</verse>
<verse>Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; We will sing and praise Your power.</verse>
