<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="70">
<verse>O God, hasten to deliver me; O LORD, hasten to my help!</verse>
<verse>Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.</verse>
<verse>Let those be turned back because of their shame Who say, "Aha, aha!"</verse>
<verse>Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified."</verse>
<verse>But I am afflicted and needy; Hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.</verse>
