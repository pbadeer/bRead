<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="56">
<verse>Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me.</verse>
<verse>My foes have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me.</verse>
<verse>When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere man do to me?</verse>
<verse>All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.</verse>
<verse>They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited to take my life.</verse>
<verse>Because of wickedness, cast them forth, In anger put down the peoples, O God!</verse>
<verse>You have taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?</verse>
<verse>Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me.</verse>
<verse>In God, whose word I praise, In the LORD, whose word I praise,</verse>
<verse>In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?</verse>
<verse>Your vows are binding upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.</verse>
<verse>For You have delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living.</verse>
