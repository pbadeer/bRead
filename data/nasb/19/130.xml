<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="130">
<verse>Out of the depths I have cried to You, O LORD.</verse>
<verse>Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.</verse>
<verse>If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?</verse>
<verse>But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.</verse>
<verse>I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait, And in His word do I hope.</verse>
<verse>My soul waits for the Lord More than the watchmen for the morning; Indeed, more than the watchmen for the morning.</verse>
<verse>O Israel, hope in the LORD; For with the LORD there is lovingkindness, And with Him is abundant redemption.</verse>
<verse>And He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.</verse>
