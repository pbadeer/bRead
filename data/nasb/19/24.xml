<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="24">
<verse>The earth is the LORD'S, and all it contains, The world, and those who dwell in it.</verse>
<verse>For He has founded it upon the seas And established it upon the rivers.</verse>
<verse>Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? And who may stand in His holy place?</verse>
<verse>He who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood And has not sworn deceitfully.</verse>
<verse>He shall receive a blessing from the LORD And righteousness from the God of his salvation.</verse>
<verse>This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Your face--even Jacob. Selah.</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!</verse>
<verse>Who is the King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, The LORD mighty in battle.</verse>
<verse>Lift up your heads, O gates, And lift them up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!</verse>
<verse>Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.</verse>
