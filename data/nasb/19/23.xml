<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="23">
<verse>The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.</verse>
<verse>He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.</verse>
<verse>He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake.</verse>
<verse>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.</verse>
<verse>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.</verse>
<verse>Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</verse>
