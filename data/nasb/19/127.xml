<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="127">
<verse>Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain.</verse>
<verse>It is vain for you to rise up early, To retire late, To eat the bread of painful labors; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep.</verse>
<verse>Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward.</verse>
<verse>Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth.</verse>
<verse>How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate.</verse>
