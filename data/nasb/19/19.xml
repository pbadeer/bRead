<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="19">
<verse>The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.</verse>
<verse>Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.</verse>
<verse>There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.</verse>
<verse>Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their utterances to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun,</verse>
<verse>Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.</verse>
<verse>Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end of them; And there is nothing hidden from its heat.</verse>
<verse>The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</verse>
<verse>The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.</verse>
<verse>They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.</verse>
<verse>Moreover, by them Your servant is warned; In keeping them there is great reward.</verse>
<verse>Who can discern his errors? Acquit me of hidden faults.</verse>
<verse>Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not rule over me; Then I will be blameless, And I shall be acquitted of great transgression.</verse>
<verse>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.</verse>
