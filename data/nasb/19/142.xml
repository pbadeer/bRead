<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="142">
<verse>I cry aloud with my voice to the LORD; I make supplication with my voice to the LORD.</verse>
<verse>I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him.</verse>
<verse>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew my path. In the way where I walk They have hidden a trap for me.</verse>
<verse>Look to the right and see; For there is no one who regards me; There is no escape for me; No one cares for my soul.</verse>
<verse>I cried out to You, O LORD; I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.</verse>
<verse>"Give heed to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.</verse>
<verse>"Bring my soul out of prison, So that I may give thanks to Your name; The righteous will surround me, For You will deal bountifully with me."</verse>
