<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book-id="19" n="82">
<verse>God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers.</verse>
<verse>How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.</verse>
<verse>Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.</verse>
<verse>Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.</verse>
<verse>They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken.</verse>
<verse>I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High.</verse>
<verse>"Nevertheless you will die like men And fall like any one of the princes."</verse>
<verse>Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is You who possesses all the nations.</verse>
