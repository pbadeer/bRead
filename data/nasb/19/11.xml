<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Psalms" book_id="19" n="11">
<verse>In the LORD I take refuge; How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain;</verse>
<verse>For, behold, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</verse>
<verse>If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?"</verse>
<verse>The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD'S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men.</verse>
<verse>The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, And the one who loves violence His soul hates.</verse>
<verse>Upon the wicked He will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup.</verse>
<verse>For the LORD is righteous, He loves righteousness; The upright will behold His face.</verse>
