<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book-id="20" n="4">
<verse>Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention that you may gain understanding,</verse>
<verse>For I give you sound teaching; Do not abandon my instruction.</verse>
<verse>When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother,</verse>
<verse>Then he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live;</verse>
<verse>Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.</verse>
<verse>"Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch over you.</verse>
<verse>"The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom; And with all your acquiring, get understanding.</verse>
<verse>"Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her.</verse>
<verse>"She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty."</verse>
<verse>Hear, my son, and accept my sayings And the years of your life will be many.</verse>
<verse>I have directed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths.</verse>
<verse>When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; And if you run, you will not stumble.</verse>
<verse>Take hold of instruction; do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life.</verse>
<verse>Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in the way of evil men.</verse>
<verse>Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on.</verse>
<verse>For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; And they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.</verse>
<verse>For they eat the bread of wickedness And drink the wine of violence.</verse>
<verse>But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, That shines brighter and brighter until the full day.</verse>
<verse>The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know over what they stumble.</verse>
<verse>My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.</verse>
<verse>Do not let them depart from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart.</verse>
<verse>For they are life to those who find them And health to all their body.</verse>
<verse>Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it flow the springs of life.</verse>
<verse>Put away from you a deceitful mouth And put devious speech far from you.</verse>
<verse>Let your eyes look directly ahead And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you.</verse>
<verse>Watch the path of your feet And all your ways will be established.</verse>
<verse>Do not turn to the right nor to the left; Turn your foot from evil.</verse>
