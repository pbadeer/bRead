<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Proverbs" book_id="20" n="9">
<verse>Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars;</verse>
<verse>She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table;</verse>
<verse>She has sent out her maidens, she calls From the tops of the heights of the city:</verse>
<verse>"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks understanding she says,</verse>
<verse>"Come, eat of my food And drink of the wine I have mixed.</verse>
<verse>"Forsake your folly and live, And proceed in the way of understanding."</verse>
<verse>He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And he who reproves a wicked man gets insults for himself.</verse>
<verse>Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you, Reprove a wise man and he will love you.</verse>
<verse>Give instruction to a wise man and he will be still wiser, Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning.</verse>
<verse>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</verse>
<verse>For by me your days will be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you.</verse>
<verse>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you alone will bear it.</verse>
<verse>The woman of folly is boisterous, She is naive and knows nothing.</verse>
<verse>She sits at the doorway of her house, On a seat by the high places of the city,</verse>
<verse>Calling to those who pass by, Who are making their paths straight:</verse>
<verse>"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here," And to him who lacks understanding she says,</verse>
<verse>"Stolen water is sweet; And bread eaten in secret is pleasant."</verse>
<verse>But he does not know that the dead are there, That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</verse>
