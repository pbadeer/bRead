<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="1 Timothy" book_id="54" n="2">
<verse>First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,</verse>
<verse>for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
<verse>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
<verse>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
<verse>For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.</verse>
<verse>For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.</verse>
<verse>Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,</verse>
<verse>but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.</verse>
<verse>A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.</verse>
<verse>But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.</verse>
<verse>For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.</verse>
<verse>And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.</verse>
<verse>But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.</verse>
