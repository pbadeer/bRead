<verse>Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food.</verse>
<verse>So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.</verse>
<verse>"Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.</verse>
<verse>"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."</verse>
<verse>The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.</verse>
<verse>And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them.</verse>
<verse>The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.</verse>
<verse>And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
<verse>But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.</verse>
<verse>But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.</verse>
<verse>Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."</verse>
<verse>And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council.</verse>
<verse>They put forward false witnesses who said, "This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law;</verse>
<verse>for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us."</verse>
<verse>And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel.</verse>
