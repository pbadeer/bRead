<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Lamentations" book_id="25" n="5">
<verse>Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; Look, and see our reproach!</verse>
<verse>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to aliens.</verse>
<verse>We have become orphans without a father, Our mothers are like widows.</verse>
<verse>We have to pay for our drinking water, Our wood comes to us at a price.</verse>
<verse>Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, there is no rest for us.</verse>
<verse>We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</verse>
<verse>Our fathers sinned, and are no more; It is we who have borne their iniquities.</verse>
<verse>Slaves rule over us; There is no one to deliver us from their hand.</verse>
<verse>We get our bread at the risk of our lives Because of the sword in the wilderness.</verse>
<verse>Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.</verse>
<verse>They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.</verse>
<verse>Princes were hung by their hands; Elders were not respected.</verse>
<verse>Young men worked at the grinding mill, And youths stumbled under loads of wood.</verse>
<verse>Elders are gone from the gate, Young men from their music.</verse>
<verse>The joy of our hearts has ceased; Our dancing has been turned into mourning.</verse>
<verse>The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us, for we have sinned!</verse>
<verse>Because of this our heart is faint, Because of these things our eyes are dim;</verse>
<verse>Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, Foxes prowl in it.</verse>
<verse>You, O LORD, rule forever; Your throne is from generation to generation.</verse>
<verse>Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long?</verse>
<verse>Restore us to You, O LORD, that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old,</verse>
<verse>Unless You have utterly rejected us And are exceedingly angry with us.</verse>
