<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="1 Corinthians" book-id="46" n="13">
<verse>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
<verse>If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
<verse>And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.</verse>
<verse>Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,</verse>
<verse>does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,</verse>
<verse>does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;</verse>
<verse>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
<verse>Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.</verse>
<verse>For we know in part and we prophesy in part;</verse>
<verse>but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.</verse>
<verse>When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.</verse>
<verse>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.</verse>
<verse>But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
