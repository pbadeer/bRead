<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="1 Corinthians" book-id="46" n="3">
<verse>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.</verse>
<verse>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,</verse>
<verse>for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?</verse>
<verse>For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not mere men?</verse>
<verse>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.</verse>
<verse>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.</verse>
<verse>So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.</verse>
<verse>Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
<verse>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.</verse>
<verse>According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
<verse>For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
<verse>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
<verse>each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.</verse>
<verse>If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.</verse>
<verse>If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</verse>
<verse>Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
<verse>If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.</verse>
<verse>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise.</verse>
<verse>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, "He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS";</verse>
<verse>and again, "THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS."</verse>
<verse>So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,</verse>
<verse>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,</verse>
<verse>and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
