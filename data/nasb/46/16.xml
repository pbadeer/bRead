<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="1 Corinthians" book-id="46" n="16">
<verse>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.</verse>
<verse>On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come.</verse>
<verse>When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;</verse>
<verse>and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.</verse>
<verse>But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;</verse>
<verse>and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.</verse>
<verse>For I do not wish to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.</verse>
<verse>But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;</verse>
<verse>for a wide door for effective service has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</verse>
<verse>Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am.</verse>
<verse>So let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.</verse>
<verse>But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.</verse>
<verse>Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.</verse>
<verse>Let all that you do be done in love.</verse>
<verse>Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints),</verse>
<verse>that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</verse>
<verse>I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.</verse>
<verse>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.</verse>
<verse>The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</verse>
<verse>All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
<verse>The greeting is in my own hand--Paul.</verse>
<verse>If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha.</verse>
<verse>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</verse>
<verse>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
