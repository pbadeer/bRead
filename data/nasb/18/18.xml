<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,</verse>
<verse>"How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding and then we can talk.</verse>
<verse>"Why are we regarded as beasts, As stupid in your eyes?</verse>
<verse>"O you who tear yourself in your anger--For your sake is the earth to be abandoned, Or the rock to be moved from its place?</verse>
<verse>"Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the flame of his fire gives no light.</verse>
<verse>"The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him.</verse>
<verse>"His vigorous stride is shortened, And his own scheme brings him down.</verse>
<verse>"For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing.</verse>
<verse>"A snare seizes him by the heel, And a trap snaps shut on him.</verse>
<verse>"A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path.</verse>
<verse>"All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step.</verse>
<verse>"His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side.</verse>
<verse>"His skin is devoured by disease, The firstborn of death devours his limbs.</verse>
<verse>"He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors.</verse>
<verse>"There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.</verse>
<verse>"His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above.</verse>
<verse>"Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad.</verse>
<verse>"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world.</verse>
<verse>"He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned.</verse>
<verse>"Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror.</verse>
<verse>"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God."</verse>
