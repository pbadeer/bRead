<verse>Then Elihu continued and said,</verse>
<verse>"Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God's behalf.</verse>
<verse>"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
<verse>"For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, God is mighty but does not despise any; He is mighty in strength of understanding.</verse>
<verse>"He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted.</verse>
<verse>"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.</verse>
<verse>"And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction,</verse>
<verse>Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves.</verse>
<verse>"He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil.</verse>
<verse>"If they hear and serve Him, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures.</verse>
<verse>"But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword And they will die without knowledge.</verse>
<verse>"But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them.</verse>
<verse>"They die in youth, And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.</verse>
<verse>"He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in time of oppression.</verse>
<verse>"Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.</verse>
<verse>"But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.</verse>
<verse>"Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.</verse>
<verse>"Will your riches keep you from distress, Or all the forces of your strength?</verse>
<verse>"Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place.</verse>
<verse>"Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you have preferred this to affliction.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?</verse>
<verse>"Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'You have done wrong'?</verse>
<verse>"Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung.</verse>
<verse>"All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The number of His years is unsearchable.</verse>
<verse>"For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist,</verse>
<verse>Which the clouds pour down, They drip upon man abundantly.</verse>
<verse>"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His pavilion?</verse>
<verse>"Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea.</verse>
<verse>"For by these He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance.</verse>
<verse>"He covers His hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark.</verse>
<verse>"Its noise declares His presence; The cattle also, concerning what is coming up.</verse>
