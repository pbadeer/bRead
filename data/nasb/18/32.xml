<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="32">
<verse>Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
<verse>But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God.</verse>
<verse>And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
<verse>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.</verse>
<verse>And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.</verse>
<verse>So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.</verse>
<verse>"I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom.</verse>
<verse>"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.</verse>
<verse>"The abundant in years may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice.</verse>
<verse>"So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.'</verse>
<verse>"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say.</verse>
<verse>"I even paid close attention to you; Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words.</verse>
<verse>"Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.'</verse>
<verse>"For he has not arranged his words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.</verse>
<verse>"They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have failed them.</verse>
<verse>"Shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop and no longer answer?</verse>
<verse>"I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion.</verse>
<verse>"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst.</verse>
<verse>"Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.</verse>
<verse>"Let me now be partial to no one, Nor flatter any man.</verse>
<verse>"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away.</verse>
