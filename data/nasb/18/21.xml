<verse>Then Job answered,</verse>
<verse>"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your way of consolation.</verse>
<verse>"Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock.</verse>
<verse>"As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?</verse>
<verse>"Look at me, and be astonished, And put your hand over your mouth.</verse>
<verse>"Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh.</verse>
<verse>"Why do the wicked still live, Continue on, also become very powerful?</verse>
<verse>"Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes,</verse>
<verse>Their houses are safe from fear, And the rod of God is not on them.</verse>
<verse>"His ox mates without fail; His cow calves and does not abort.</verse>
<verse>"They send forth their little ones like the flock, And their children skip about.</verse>
<verse>"They sing to the timbrel and harp And rejoice at the sound of the flute.</verse>
<verse>"They spend their days in prosperity, And suddenly they go down to Sheol.</verse>
<verse>"They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways.</verse>
<verse>'Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?'</verse>
<verse>"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
<verse>"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or does their calamity fall on them? Does God apportion destruction in His anger?</verse>
<verse>"Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away?</verse>
<verse>"You say, 'God stores away a man's iniquity for his sons.' Let God repay him so that he may know it.</verse>
<verse>"Let his own eyes see his decay, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</verse>
<verse>"For what does he care for his household after him, When the number of his months is cut off?</verse>
<verse>"Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high?</verse>
<verse>"One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and satisfied;</verse>
<verse>His sides are filled out with fat, And the marrow of his bones is moist,</verse>
<verse>While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting anything good.</verse>
<verse>"Together they lie down in the dust, And worms cover them.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plans by which you would wrong me.</verse>
<verse>"For you say, 'Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?'</verse>
<verse>"Have you not asked wayfaring men, And do you not recognize their witness?</verse>
<verse>"For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity; They will be led forth at the day of fury.</verse>
<verse>"Who will confront him with his actions, And who will repay him for what he has done?</verse>
<verse>"While he is carried to the grave, Men will keep watch over his tomb.</verse>
<verse>"The clods of the valley will gently cover him; Moreover, all men will follow after him, While countless ones go before him.</verse>
<verse>"How then will you vainly comfort me, For your answers remain full of falsehood?"</verse>
