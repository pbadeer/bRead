<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Job" book-id="18" n="35">
<verse>Then Elihu continued and said,</verse>
<verse>"Do you think this is according to justice? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'?</verse>
<verse>"For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?'</verse>
<verse>"I will answer you, And your friends with you.</verse>
<verse>"Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds--they are higher than you.</verse>
<verse>"If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?</verse>
<verse>"If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, Or what does He receive from your hand?</verse>
<verse>"Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, And your righteousness is for a son of man.</verse>
<verse>"Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
<verse>"But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,</verse>
<verse>Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'</verse>
<verse>"There they cry out, but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
<verse>"Surely God will not listen to an empty cry, Nor will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
<verse>"How much less when you say you do not behold Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!</verse>
<verse>"And now, because He has not visited in His anger, Nor has He acknowledged transgression well,</verse>
<verse>So Job opens his mouth emptily; He multiplies words without knowledge."</verse>
