<verse>Then Job responded,</verse>
<verse>"What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength!</verse>
<verse>"What counsel you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!</verse>
<verse>"To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?</verse>
<verse>"The departed spirits tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants.</verse>
<verse>"Naked is Sheol before Him, And Abaddon has no covering.</verse>
<verse>"He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing.</verse>
<verse>"He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them.</verse>
<verse>"He obscures the face of the full moon And spreads His cloud over it.</verse>
<verse>"He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness.</verse>
<verse>"The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke.</verse>
<verse>"He quieted the sea with His power, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab.</verse>
<verse>"By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?"</verse>
