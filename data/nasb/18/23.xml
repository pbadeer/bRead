<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="23">
<verse>Then Job replied,</verse>
<verse>"Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning.</verse>
<verse>"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!</verse>
<verse>"I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
<verse>"I would learn the words which He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me.</verse>
<verse>"Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power? No, surely He would pay attention to me.</verse>
<verse>"There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.</verse>
<verse>"Behold, I go forward but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;</verse>
<verse>When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him.</verse>
<verse>"But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</verse>
<verse>"My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.</verse>
<verse>"I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.</verse>
<verse>"But He is unique and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, that He does.</verse>
<verse>"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such decrees are with Him.</verse>
<verse>"Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him.</verse>
<verse>"It is God who has made my heart faint, And the Almighty who has dismayed me,</verse>
<verse>But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom which covers me.</verse>
