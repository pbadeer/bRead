<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Job" book_id="18" n="17">
<verse>"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me.</verse>
<verse>"Surely mockers are with me, And my eye gazes on their provocation.</verse>
<verse>"Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Yourself; Who is there that will be my guarantor?</verse>
<verse>"For You have kept their heart from understanding, Therefore You will not exalt them.</verse>
<verse>"He who informs against friends for a share of the spoil, The eyes of his children also will languish.</verse>
<verse>"But He has made me a byword of the people, And I am one at whom men spit.</verse>
<verse>"My eye has also grown dim because of grief, And all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
<verse>"The upright will be appalled at this, And the innocent will stir up himself against the godless.</verse>
<verse>"Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.</verse>
<verse>"But come again all of you now, For I do not find a wise man among you.</verse>
<verse>"My days are past, my plans are torn apart, Even the wishes of my heart.</verse>
<verse>"They make night into day, saying, 'The light is near,' in the presence of darkness.</verse>
<verse>"If I look for Sheol as my home, I make my bed in the darkness;</verse>
<verse>If I call to the pit, 'You are my father'; To the worm, 'my mother and my sister';</verse>
<verse>Where now is my hope? And who regards my hope?</verse>
<verse>"Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?"</verse>
