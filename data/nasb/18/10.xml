<verse>"I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
<verse>"I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Let me know why You contend with me.</verse>
<verse>'Is it right for You indeed to oppress, To reject the labor of Your hands, And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?</verse>
<verse>'Have You eyes of flesh? Or do You see as a man sees?</verse>
<verse>'Are Your days as the days of a mortal, Or Your years as man's years,</verse>
<verse>That You should seek for my guilt And search after my sin?</verse>
<verse>'According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty, Yet there is no deliverance from Your hand.</verse>
<verse>'Your hands fashioned and made me altogether, And would You destroy me?</verse>
<verse>'Remember now, that You have made me as clay; And would You turn me into dust again?</verse>
<verse>'Did You not pour me out like milk And curdle me like cheese;</verse>
<verse>Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews?</verse>
<verse>'You have granted me life and lovingkindness; And Your care has preserved my spirit.</verse>
<verse>'Yet these things You have concealed in Your heart; I know that this is within You:</verse>
<verse>If I sin, then You would take note of me, And would not acquit me of my guilt.</verse>
<verse>'If I am wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. I am sated with disgrace and conscious of my misery.</verse>
<verse>'Should my head be lifted up, You would hunt me like a lion; And again You would show Your power against me.</verse>
<verse>'You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me.</verse>
<verse>'Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me!</verse>
<verse>'I should have been as though I had not been, Carried from womb to tomb.'</verse>
<verse>"Would He not let my few days alone? Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer</verse>
<verse>Before I go--and I shall not return--To the land of darkness and deep shadow,</verse>
<verse>The land of utter gloom as darkness itself, Of deep shadow without order, And which shines as the darkness."</verse>
