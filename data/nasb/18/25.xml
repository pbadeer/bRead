<verse>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</verse>
<verse>"Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights.</verse>
<verse>"Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?</verse>
<verse>"How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?</verse>
<verse>"If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,</verse>
<verse>How much less man, that maggot, And the son of man, that worm!"</verse>
