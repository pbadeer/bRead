<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book_id="28" n="14">
<verse>Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity.</verse>
<verse>Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the fruit of our lips.</verse>
<verse>"Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, 'Our god,' To the work of our hands; For in You the orphan finds mercy."</verse>
<verse>I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from them.</verse>
<verse>I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
<verse>His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
<verse>Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</verse>
<verse>O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; From Me comes your fruit.</verse>
<verse>Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; Whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble in them.</verse>
