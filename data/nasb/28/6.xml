<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book-id="28" n="6">
<verse>"Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.</verse>
<verse>"He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.</verse>
<verse>"So let us know, let us press on to know the LORD. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth."</verse>
<verse>What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud And like the dew which goes away early.</verse>
<verse>Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are like the light that goes forth.</verse>
<verse>For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</verse>
<verse>But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me.</verse>
<verse>Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody footprints.</verse>
<verse>And as raiders wait for a man, So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they have committed crime.</verse>
<verse>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself.</verse>
<verse>Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people.</verse>
