<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book_id="28" n="3">
<verse>Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."</verse>
<verse>So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley.</verse>
<verse>Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you."</verse>
<verse>For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without ephod or household idols.</verse>
<verse>Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.</verse>
