<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Hosea" book-id="28" n="12">
<verse>Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt.</verse>
<verse>The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.</verse>
<verse>In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God.</verse>
<verse>Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel And there He spoke with us,</verse>
<verse>Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name.</verse>
<verse>Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually.</verse>
<verse>A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress.</verse>
<verse>And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which would be sin."</verse>
<verse>But I have been the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival.</verse>
<verse>I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions, And through the prophets I gave parables.</verse>
<verse>Is there iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field.</verse>
<verse>Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep.</verse>
<verse>But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept.</verse>
<verse>Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him And bring back his reproach to him.</verse>
