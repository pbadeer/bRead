<verse>"When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out from his house,</verse>
<verse>and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man's wife,</verse>
<verse>and if the latter husband turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife,</verse>
<verse>then her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife, since she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.</verse>
<verse>"When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army nor be charged with any duty; he shall be free at home one year and shall give happiness to his wife whom he has taken.</verse>
<verse>"No one shall take a handmill or an upper millstone in pledge, for he would be taking a life in pledge.</verse>
<verse>"If a man is caught kidnapping any of his countrymen of the sons of Israel, and he deals with him violently or sells him, then that thief shall die; so you shall purge the evil from among you.</verse>
<verse>"Be careful against an infection of leprosy, that you diligently observe and do according to all that the Levitical priests teach you; as I have commanded them, so you shall be careful to do.</verse>
<verse>"Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way as you came out of Egypt.</verse>
<verse>"When you make your neighbor a loan of any sort, you shall not enter his house to take his pledge.</verse>
<verse>"You shall remain outside, and the man to whom you make the loan shall bring the pledge out to you.</verse>
<verse>"If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge.</verse>
<verse>"When the sun goes down you shall surely return the pledge to him, that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you; and it will be righteousness for you before the LORD your God.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your countrymen or one of your aliens who is in your land in your towns.</verse>
<verse>"You shall give him his wages on his day before the sun sets, for he is poor and sets his heart on it; so that he will not cry against you to the LORD and it become sin in you.</verse>
<verse>"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.</verse>
<verse>"You shall not pervert the justice due an alien or an orphan, nor take a widow's garment in pledge.</verse>
<verse>"But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.</verse>
<verse>"When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.</verse>
<verse>"When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.</verse>
<verse>"When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not go over it again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.</verse>
<verse>"You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.</verse>
