<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="2 Corinthians" book-id="47" n="2">
<verse>But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.</verse>
<verse>For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful?</verse>
<verse>This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all.</verse>
<verse>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.</verse>
<verse>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree--in order not to say too much--to all of you.</verse>
<verse>Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,</verse>
<verse>so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
<verse>Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.</verse>
<verse>For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.</verse>
<verse>But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</verse>
<verse>so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</verse>
<verse>Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,</verse>
<verse>I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.</verse>
<verse>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.</verse>
<verse>For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;</verse>
<verse>to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?</verse>
<verse>For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.</verse>
