<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Mark" book-id="41" n="15">
<verse>Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.</verse>
<verse>Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He answered him, "It is as you say."</verse>
<verse>The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly.</verse>
<verse>Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!"</verse>
<verse>But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.</verse>
<verse>Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.</verse>
<verse>The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
<verse>The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.</verse>
<verse>Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
<verse>For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.</verse>
<verse>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.</verse>
<verse>Answering again, Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</verse>
<verse>They shouted back, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
<verse>But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
<verse>Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.</verse>
<verse>The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they called together the whole Roman cohort.</verse>
<verse>They dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;</verse>
<verse>and they began to acclaim Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
<verse>They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him.</verse>
<verse>After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him.</verse>
<verse>They pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.</verse>
<verse>Then they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.</verse>
<verse>They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.</verse>
<verse>And they crucified Him, and divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take.</verse>
<verse>It was the third hour when they crucified Him.</verse>
<verse>The inscription of the charge against Him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</verse>
<verse>They crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.</verse>
<verse>[ And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with transgressors."]</verse>
<verse>Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,</verse>
<verse>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"</verse>
<verse>In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself.</verse>
<verse>"Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him.</verse>
<verse>When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
<verse>At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" which is translated, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"</verse>
<verse>When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, "Behold, He is calling for Elijah."</verse>
<verse>Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down."</verse>
<verse>And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.</verse>
<verse>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
<verse>When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</verse>
<verse>There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.</verse>
<verse>When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
<verse>Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
<verse>Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.</verse>
<verse>And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
<verse>Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</verse>
<verse>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid.</verse>
