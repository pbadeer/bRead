<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Revelation" book-id="66" n="5">
<verse>I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.</verse>
<verse>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?"</verse>
<verse>And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.</verse>
<verse>Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it;</verse>
<verse>and one of the elders said to me, "Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals."</verse>
<verse>And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</verse>
<verse>And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.</verse>
<verse>When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
<verse>And they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
<verse>"You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth."</verse>
<verse>Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
<verse>saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."</verse>
<verse>And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, "To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever."</verse>
<verse>And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
