<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Revelation" book_id="66" n="15">
<verse>Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.</verse>
<verse>And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.</verse>
<verse>And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!</verse>
<verse>"Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED."</verse>
<verse>After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,</verse>
<verse>and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.</verse>
<verse>Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
<verse>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.</verse>
