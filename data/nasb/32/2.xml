<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Jonah" book-id="32" n="2">
<verse>Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish,</verse>
<verse>and he said, "I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice.</verse>
<verse>"For You had cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Your breakers and billows passed over me.</verse>
<verse>"So I said, 'I have been expelled from Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.'</verse>
<verse>"Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head.</verse>
<verse>"I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, But You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.</verse>
<verse>"While I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple.</verse>
<verse>"Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness,</verse>
<verse>But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD."</verse>
<verse>Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.</verse>
