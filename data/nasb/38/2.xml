<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Zechariah" book-id="38" n="2">
<verse>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
<verse>So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is."</verse>
<verse>And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,</verse>
<verse>and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.</verse>
<verse>'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"</verse>
<verse>"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD.</verse>
<verse>"Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."</verse>
<verse>For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.</verse>
<verse>"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.</verse>
<verse>"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.</verse>
<verse>"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.</verse>
<verse>"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."</verse>
