<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="1 Peter" book_id="60" n="5">
<verse>Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,</verse>
<verse>shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;</verse>
<verse>nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.</verse>
<verse>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
<verse>You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.</verse>
<verse>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,</verse>
<verse>casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.</verse>
<verse>Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</verse>
<verse>But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.</verse>
<verse>After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.</verse>
<verse>To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
<verse>Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!</verse>
<verse>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark.</verse>
<verse>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.</verse>
