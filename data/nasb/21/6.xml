<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Ecclesiastes" book-id="21" n="6">
<verse>Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil.</verse>
<verse>Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.</verse>
<verse>For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words.</verse>
<verse>When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!</verse>
<verse>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
<verse>Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</verse>
<verse>For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.</verse>
<verse>If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them.</verse>
<verse>After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.</verse>
<verse>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity.</verse>
<verse>When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?</verse>
<verse>The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.</verse>
