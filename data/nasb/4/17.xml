<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Numbers" book-id="4" n="17">
<verse>Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
<verse>"Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father's household: twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers' households. You shall write each name on his rod,</verse>
<verse>and write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers' households.</verse>
<verse>"You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you.</verse>
<verse>"It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you."</verse>
<verse>Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers' households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.</verse>
<verse>So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.</verse>
<verse>Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.</verse>
<verse>Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod.</verse>
<verse>But the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they will not die."</verse>
<verse>Thus Moses did; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did.</verse>
<verse>Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish, we are dying, we are all dying!</verse>
<verse>"Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?"</verse>
