<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="64">
<verse>Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, That the mountains might quake at Your presence--</verse>
<verse>As fire kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil--To make Your name known to Your adversaries, That the nations may tremble at Your presence!</verse>
<verse>When You did awesome things which we did not expect, You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence.</verse>
<verse>For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, Nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him.</verse>
<verse>You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, Who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned, We continued in them a long time; And shall we be saved?</verse>
<verse>For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</verse>
<verse>There is no one who calls on Your name, Who arouses himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have delivered us into the power of our iniquities.</verse>
<verse>But now, O LORD, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand.</verse>
<verse>Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD, Nor remember iniquity forever; Behold, look now, all of us are Your people.</verse>
<verse>Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
<verse>Our holy and beautiful house, Where our fathers praised You, Has been burned by fire; And all our precious things have become a ruin.</verse>
<verse>Will You restrain Yourself at these things, O LORD? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?</verse>
