<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="15">
<verse>The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.</verse>
<verse>They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, even to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald and every beard is cut off.</verse>
<verse>In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.</verse>
<verse>Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him.</verse>
<verse>My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their ruin.</verse>
<verse>For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing.</verse>
<verse>Therefore the abundance which they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim.</verse>
<verse>For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail goes as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim.</verse>
<verse>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added woes upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.</verse>
