<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book_id="23" n="20">
<verse>In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,</verse>
<verse>at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet." And he did so, going naked and barefoot.</verse>
<verse>And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against Egypt and Cush,</verse>
<verse>so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.</verse>
<verse>"Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast.</verse>
<verse>"So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?'"</verse>
