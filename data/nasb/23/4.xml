<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Isaiah" book-id="23" n="4">
<verse>For seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach!"</verse>
<verse>In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and the adornment of the survivors of Israel.</verse>
<verse>It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy--everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem.</verse>
<verse>When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning,</verse>
<verse>then the LORD will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.</verse>
<verse>There will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain.</verse>
