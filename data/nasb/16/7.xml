<verse>Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>
<verse>then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.</verse>
<verse>Then I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house."</verse>
<verse>Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built.</verse>
<verse>Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record:</verse>
<verse>These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,</verse>
<verse>who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of men of the people of Israel:</verse>

<verse>All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392.</verse>
<verse>These were they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses or their descendants, whether they were of Israel:</verse>
<verse>the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642.</verse>
<verse>Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them.</verse>
<verse>These searched among their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.</verse>
<verse>The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.</verse>
<verse>The whole assembly together was 42,360,</verse>
<verse>besides their male and their female servants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had 245 male and female singers.</verse>
<verse>Their horses were 736; their mules, 245;</verse>
<verse>their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720.</verse>
<verse>Some from among the heads of fathers' households gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 gold drachmas, 50 basins, 530 priests' garments.</verse>
<verse>Some of the heads of fathers' households gave into the treasury of the work 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas.</verse>
<verse>That which the rest of the people gave was 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,000 silver minas and 67 priests' garments.</verse>
<verse>Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants and all Israel, lived in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.</verse>
