<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Titus" book-id="56" n="2">
<verse>But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.</verse>
<verse>Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.</verse>
<verse>Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,</verse>
<verse>so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
<verse>to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.</verse>
<verse>Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;</verse>
<verse>in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,</verse>
<verse>sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
<verse>Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,</verse>
<verse>not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.</verse>
<verse>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
<verse>instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,</verse>
<verse>looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,</verse>
<verse>who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.</verse>
<verse>These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.</verse>
