<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Titus" book_id="56" n="3">
<verse>Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,</verse>
<verse>to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men.</verse>
<verse>For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</verse>
<verse>But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,</verse>
<verse>He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
<verse>whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
<verse>so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
<verse>This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.</verse>
<verse>But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.</verse>
<verse>Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,</verse>
<verse>knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.</verse>
<verse>When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
<verse>Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.</verse>
<verse>Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.</verse>
<verse>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
