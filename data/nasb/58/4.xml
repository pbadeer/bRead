<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="Hebrews" book_id="58" n="4">
<verse>Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.</verse>
<verse>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.</verse>
<verse>For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, "AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
<verse>For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: "AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS";</verse>
<verse>and again in this passage, "THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST."</verse>
<verse>Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,</verse>
<verse>He again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS."</verse>
<verse>For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.</verse>
<verse>So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
<verse>For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.</verse>
<verse>Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.</verse>
<verse>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</verse>
<verse>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</verse>
<verse>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
<verse>For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
<verse>Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
