<chapter translation="NASB" testament="New" book="3 John" book_id="64" n="1">
<verse>The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</verse>
<verse>Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.</verse>
<verse>For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.</verse>
<verse>I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</verse>
<verse>Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;</verse>
<verse>and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.</verse>
<verse>For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
<verse>Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth.</verse>
<verse>I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.</verse>
<verse>For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church.</verse>
<verse>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
<verse>Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
<verse>I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;</verse>
<verse>but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.</verse>
