<chapter translation="NASB" testament="Old" book="Song of Solomon" book-id="22" n="7">
<verse>"How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your hips are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist.</verse>
<verse>"Your navel is like a round goblet Which never lacks mixed wine; Your belly is like a heap of wheat Fenced about with lilies.</verse>
<verse>"Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle.</verse>
<verse>"Your neck is like a tower of ivory, Your eyes like the pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, Which faces toward Damascus.</verse>
<verse>"Your head crowns you like Carmel, And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads; The king is captivated by your tresses.</verse>
<verse>"How beautiful and how delightful you are, My love, with all your charms!</verse>
<verse>"Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are like its clusters.</verse>
<verse>"I said, 'I will climb the palm tree, I will take hold of its fruit stalks.' Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples,</verse>
<verse>And your mouth like the best wine! It goes down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently through the lips of those who fall asleep.</verse>
<verse>"I am my beloved's, And his desire is for me.</verse>
<verse>"Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country, Let us spend the night in the villages.</verse>
<verse>"Let us rise early and go to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded And its blossoms have opened, And whether the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love.</verse>
<verse>"The mandrakes have given forth fragrance; And over our doors are all choice fruits, Both new and old, Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.</verse>
