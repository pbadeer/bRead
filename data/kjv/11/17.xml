      <verse>And Elijah the Tishbite, <supplied>who was</supplied> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, <supplied>As</supplied> the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
</verse><verse>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
</verse><verse>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that <supplied>is</supplied> before Jordan.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, <supplied>that</supplied> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
</verse><verse>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <supplied>is</supplied> before Jordan.
</verse><verse>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.

      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
</verse><verse>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <supplied>belongeth</supplied> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
</verse><verse>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <supplied>was</supplied> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
</verse><verse>And as she was going to fetch <supplied>it,</supplied> he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
</verse><verse>And she said, <supplied>As</supplied> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may
eat it, and die.
</verse><verse>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <supplied>and</supplied> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <supplied>it</supplied> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <supplied>that</supplied> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <supplied>many</supplied> days.
</verse><verse><supplied>And</supplied> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.

      <verse>And it came to pass after these things, <supplied>that</supplied> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
</verse><verse>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
</verse><verse>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
</verse><verse>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
</verse><verse>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child&#x2019;s soul come into him again.
</verse><verse>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
</verse><verse>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <supplied>art</supplied> a man of God, <supplied>and</supplied> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <supplied>is</supplied> truth.
