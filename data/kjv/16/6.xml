      <verse>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <supplied>that</supplied> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors
upon the gates;)
</verse><verse>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <supplied>some one of</supplied> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
</verse><verse>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <supplied>am</supplied> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
</verse><verse>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
</verse><verse>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
</verse><verse>Wherein <supplied>was</supplied> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <supplied>it, that</supplied> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
</verse><verse>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <supplied>There is</supplied> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
</verse><verse>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
</verse><verse>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <supplied>O God,</supplied> strengthen my hands.
</verse><verse>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <supplied>was</supplied> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will
come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
</verse><verse>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <supplied>is there,</supplied> that, <supplied>being</supplied> as I <supplied>am,</supplied> would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
</verse><verse>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
</verse><verse>Therefore <supplied>was</supplied> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <supplied>that</supplied> they might have <supplied>matter</supplied> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
</verse><verse>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

      <verse>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <supplied>day</supplied> of <supplied>the month</supplied> Elul, in fifty and two days.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <supplied>thereof,</supplied> and all the heathen that <supplied>were</supplied> about us saw <supplied>these things,</supplied> they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our
God.

      <verse>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <supplied>the letters</supplied> of Tobiah came unto them.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>there were</supplied> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <supplied>was</supplied> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
</verse><verse>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <supplied>And</supplied> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
