      <verse>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <supplied>there is</supplied> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
</verse><verse>The good <supplied>man</supplied> is perished out of the earth: and <supplied>there is</supplied> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <supplied>asketh</supplied> for a reward; and the great <supplied>man,</supplied> he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
</verse><verse>The best of them <supplied>is</supplied> as a brier: the most upright <supplied>is sharper</supplied> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <supplied>and</supplied> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
</verse><verse>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man&#x2019;s enemies <supplied>are</supplied> the men of his own house.
</verse><verse>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <supplied>shall be</supplied> a light unto me.
</verse><verse>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <supplied>and</supplied> I shall behold his righteousness.
</verse><verse>Then <supplied>she that is</supplied> mine enemy shall see <supplied>it,</supplied> and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
</verse><verse><supplied>In</supplied> the day that thy walls are to be built, <supplied>in</supplied> that day shall the decree be far removed.
</verse><verse><supplied>In</supplied> that day <supplied>also</supplied> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <supplied>from</supplied> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <supplied>from</supplied> mountain to mountain.
</verse><verse>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <supplied>in</supplied> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <supplied>in</supplied> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
</verse><verse>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <supplied>things.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <supplied>their</supplied> hand upon <supplied>their</supplied> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
</verse><verse>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <supplied>in</supplied> mercy.
</verse><verse>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
</verse><verse>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <supplied>and</supplied> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
