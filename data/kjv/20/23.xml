      <verse>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <supplied>is</supplied> before thee:
</verse><verse>And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <supplied>be</supplied> a man given to appetite.
</verse><verse>Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <supplied>are</supplied> deceitful meat.
</verse><verse>Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
</verse><verse>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <supplied>riches</supplied> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
</verse><verse>Eat thou not the bread of <supplied>him that hath</supplied> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
</verse><verse>For as he thinketh in his heart, so <supplied>is</supplied> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <supplied>is</supplied> not with thee.
</verse><verse>The morsel <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.
</verse><verse>Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
</verse><verse>Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
</verse><verse>For their redeemer <supplied>is</supplied> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
</verse><verse>Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
</verse><verse>Withhold not correction from the child: for <supplied>if</supplied> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
</verse><verse>My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
</verse><verse>Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
</verse><verse>Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <supplied>be thou</supplied> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
</verse><verse>For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
</verse><verse>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
</verse><verse>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
</verse><verse>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <supplied>a man</supplied> with rags.
</verse><verse>Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
</verse><verse>Buy the truth, and sell <supplied>it</supplied> not; <supplied>also</supplied> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
</verse><verse>The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <supplied>child</supplied> shall have joy of him.
</verse><verse>Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
</verse><verse>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
</verse><verse>For a whore <supplied>is</supplied> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <supplied>is</supplied> a narrow pit.
</verse><verse>She also lieth in wait as <supplied>for</supplied> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.
</verse><verse>Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
</verse><verse>They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
</verse><verse>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <supplied>when</supplied> it moveth itself aright.
</verse><verse>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
</verse><verse>Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
</verse><verse>Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
</verse><verse>They have stricken me, <supplied>shalt thou say, and</supplied> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <supplied>and</supplied> I felt <supplied>it</supplied> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
