      <verse>A false balance <supplied>is</supplied> abomination to the LORD: but a just weight <supplied>is</supplied> his delight.
</verse><verse><supplied>When</supplied> pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly <supplied>is</supplied> wisdom.
</verse><verse>The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
</verse><verse>Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.
</verse><verse>The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
</verse><verse>The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in <supplied>their own</supplied> naughtiness.
</verse><verse>When a wicked man dieth, <supplied>his</supplied> expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust <supplied>men</supplied> perisheth.
</verse><verse>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
</verse><verse>An hypocrite with <supplied>his</supplied> mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
</verse><verse>When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, <supplied>there is</supplied> shouting.
</verse><verse>By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
</verse><verse>He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
</verse><verse>A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
</verse><verse>Where no counsel <supplied>is,</supplied> the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors <supplied>there is</supplied> safety.
</verse><verse>He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <supplied>for it:</supplied> and he that hateth suretiship is sure.
</verse><verse>A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <supplied>men</supplied> retain riches.
</verse><verse>The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but <supplied>he that is</supplied> cruel troubleth his own flesh.
</verse><verse>The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <supplied>shall be</supplied> a sure reward.
</verse><verse>As righteousness <supplied>tendeth</supplied> to life: so he that pursueth evil <supplied>pursueth it</supplied> to his own death.
</verse><verse>They that are of a froward heart <supplied>are</supplied> abomination to the LORD: but <supplied>such as are</supplied> upright in <supplied>their</supplied> way <supplied>are</supplied> his delight.
</verse><verse><supplied>Though</supplied> hand <supplied>join</supplied> in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
</verse><verse><supplied>As</supplied> a jewel of gold in a swine&#x2019;s snout, <supplied>so is</supplied> a fair woman which is without discretion.
</verse><verse>The desire of the righteous <supplied>is</supplied> only good: <supplied>but</supplied> the expectation of the wicked <supplied>is</supplied> wrath.
</verse><verse>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and <supplied>there is</supplied> that withholdeth more than is meet, but <supplied>it tendeth</supplied> to poverty.
</verse><verse>The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
</verse><verse>He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon the head of him that selleth <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.
</verse><verse>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
</verse><verse>He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool <supplied>shall be</supplied> servant to the wise of heart.
</verse><verse>The fruit of the righteous <supplied>is</supplied> a tree of life; and he that winneth souls <supplied>is</supplied> wise.
</verse><verse>Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
