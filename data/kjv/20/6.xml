      <verse>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <supplied>if</supplied> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
</verse><verse>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
</verse><verse>Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
</verse><verse>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
</verse><verse>Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <supplied>of the hunter,</supplied> and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
</verse><verse>Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
</verse><verse>Provideth her meat in the summer, <supplied>and</supplied> gathereth her food in the harvest.
</verse><verse>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
</verse><verse><supplied>Yet</supplied> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
</verse><verse>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
</verse><verse>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
</verse><verse>Frowardness <supplied>is</supplied> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>These six <supplied>things</supplied> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <supplied>are</supplied> an abomination unto him:
</verse><verse>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
</verse><verse>An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
</verse><verse>A false witness <supplied>that</supplied> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>My son, keep thy father&#x2019;s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
</verse><verse>Bind them continually upon thine heart, <supplied>and</supplied> tie them about thy neck.
</verse><verse>When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <supplied>when</supplied> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
</verse><verse>For the commandment <supplied>is</supplied> a lamp; and the law <supplied>is</supplied> light; and reproofs of instruction <supplied>are</supplied> the way of life:
</verse><verse>To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
</verse><verse>Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
</verse><verse>For by means of a whorish woman <supplied>a man is brought</supplied> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
</verse><verse>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
</verse><verse>Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
</verse><verse>So he that goeth in to his neighbour&#x2019;s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
</verse><verse><supplied>Men</supplied> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
</verse><verse>But <supplied>if</supplied> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
</verse><verse><supplied>But</supplied> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <supplied>that</supplied> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
</verse><verse>A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
</verse><verse>For jealousy <supplied>is</supplied> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
</verse><verse>He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
     
      </verse>
