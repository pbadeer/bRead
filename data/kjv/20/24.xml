      <verse>Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
</verse><verse>For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
</verse><verse>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:
</verse><verse>And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
</verse><verse>A wise man <supplied>is</supplied> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
</verse><verse>For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors <supplied>there is</supplied> safety.
</verse><verse>Wisdom <supplied>is</supplied> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
</verse><verse>He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
</verse><verse>The thought of foolishness <supplied>is</supplied> sin: and the scorner <supplied>is</supplied> an abomination to men.
</verse><verse><supplied>If</supplied> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <supplied>is</supplied> small.
</verse><verse>If thou forbear to deliver <supplied>them that are</supplied> drawn unto death, and <supplied>those that are</supplied> ready to be slain;
</verse><verse>If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <supplied>it?</supplied> and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <supplied>not</supplied> he know <supplied>it?</supplied> and shall <supplied>not</supplied> he render to <supplied>every</supplied> man according to his works?
</verse><verse>My son, eat thou honey, because <supplied>it is</supplied> good; and the honeycomb, <supplied>which is</supplied> sweet to thy taste:
</verse><verse>So <supplied>shall</supplied> the knowledge of wisdom <supplied>be</supplied> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <supplied>it,</supplied> then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
</verse><verse>Lay not wait, O wicked <supplied>man,</supplied> against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:
</verse><verse>For a just <supplied>man</supplied> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
</verse><verse>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
</verse><verse>Lest the LORD see <supplied>it,</supplied> and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
</verse><verse>Fret not thyself because of evil <supplied>men,</supplied> neither be thou envious at the wicked;
</verse><verse>For there shall be no reward to the evil <supplied>man;</supplied> the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
</verse><verse>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <supplied>and</supplied> meddle not with them that are given to change:
</verse><verse>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
</verse><verse>These <supplied>things</supplied> also <supplied>belong</supplied> to the wise. <supplied>It is</supplied> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
</verse><verse>He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
</verse><verse>But to them that rebuke <supplied>him</supplied> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
</verse><verse><supplied>Every man</supplied> shall kiss <supplied>his</supplied> lips that giveth a right answer.
</verse><verse>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.
</verse><verse>Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <supplied>not</supplied> with thy lips.
</verse><verse>Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
</verse><verse>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
</verse><verse>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <supplied>and</supplied> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
</verse><verse>Then I saw, <supplied>and</supplied> considered <supplied>it</supplied> well: I looked upon <supplied>it, and</supplied> received instruction.
</verse><verse><supplied>Yet</supplied> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
</verse><verse>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
