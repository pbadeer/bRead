      <verse>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make <supplied>thy</supplied> loins strong, fortify <supplied>thy</supplied> power mightily.
</verse><verse>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.
</verse><verse>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men <supplied>are</supplied> in scarlet: the chariots <supplied>shall be</supplied> with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
</verse><verse>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
</verse><verse>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
</verse><verse>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
</verse><verse>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead <supplied>her</supplied> as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
</verse><verse>But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, <supplied>shall they cry;</supplied> but none shall look back.
</verse><verse>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for <supplied>there is</supplied> none end of the store <supplied>and</supplied> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.
</verse><verse>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain <supplied>is</supplied> in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.
</verse><verse>Where <supplied>is</supplied> the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, <supplied>even</supplied> the old lion, walked, <supplied>and</supplied> the lion&#x2019;s whelp, and none made <supplied>them</supplied> afraid?
</verse><verse>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
</verse><verse>Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be
heard.
