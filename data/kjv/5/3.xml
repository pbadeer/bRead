      <verse>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
</verse><verse>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
</verse><verse>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
</verse><verse>All these cities <supplied>were</supplied> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
</verse><verse>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
</verse><verse>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
</verse><verse>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <supplied>was</supplied> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
</verse><verse>(<supplied>Which</supplied> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
</verse><verse>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
</verse><verse>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <supplied>was</supplied> a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the
cubit of a man.
</verse><verse>And this land, <supplied>which</supplied> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
</verse><verse>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <supplied>being</supplied> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
</verse><verse>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan- havoth-jair, unto this day.
</verse><verse>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
</verse><verse>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <supplied>which is</supplied> the border of the children of Ammon;
</verse><verse>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <supplied>thereof,</supplied> from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <supplied>even</supplied> the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <supplied>that are</supplied> meet for the war.
</verse><verse>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<supplied>for</supplied> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
</verse><verse>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <supplied>until</supplied> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <supplied>then</supplied> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I
have given you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
</verse><verse>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
</verse><verse>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
</verse><verse>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <supplied>is there</supplied> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
</verse><verse>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <supplied>is</supplied> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
</verse><verse>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
</verse><verse>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <supplied>it</supplied> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
</verse><verse>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
</verse><verse>So we abode in the valley over against Beth- peor.
