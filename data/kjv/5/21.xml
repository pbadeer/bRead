      <verse>If <supplied>one</supplied> be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, <supplied>and</supplied> it be not known who hath slain him:
</verse><verse>Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which <supplied>are</supplied> round about him that is slain:
</verse><verse>And it shall be, <supplied>that</supplied> the city <supplied>which is</supplied> next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, <supplied>and</supplied> which hath not drawn in the yoke;
</verse><verse>And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer&#x2019;s neck there in the valley:
</verse><verse>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be <supplied>tried: </supplied></verse><verse>And all the
elders of that city, <supplied>that are</supplied> next unto the slain <supplied>man,</supplied> shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:
</verse><verse>And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel&#x2019;s charge.
And the blood shall be forgiven them.
</verse><verse>So shalt thou put away the <supplied>guilt of</supplied> innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do <supplied>that which is</supplied> right in the sight of the LORD.

      <verse>When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,
</verse><verse>And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;
</verse><verse>Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
</verse><verse>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, <supplied>both</supplied> the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
</verse><verse>Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit <supplied>that</supplied> which he hath, <supplied>that</supplied> he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, <supplied>which is indeed</supplied> the firstborn:
</verse><verse>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated <supplied>for</supplied> the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he <supplied>is</supplied> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn <supplied>is</supplied> his.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and <supplied>that,</supplied> when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:
</verse><verse>Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
</verse><verse>And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son <supplied>is</supplied> stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; <supplied>he is</supplied> a glutton, and a drunkard.
</verse><verse>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:
</verse><verse>His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged <supplied>is</supplied> accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <supplied>for</supplied> an
inheritance.
