      <verse>Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <supplied>do</supplied> evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest <supplied>judgment:</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If thou meet thine enemy&#x2019;s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
</verse><verse>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
</verse><verse>Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
</verse><verse>And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
</verse><verse>But the seventh <supplied>year</supplied> thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, <supplied>and</supplied> with thy oliveyard.
</verse><verse>Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
</verse><verse>And in all <supplied>things</supplied> that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
</verse><verse>And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, <supplied>which is</supplied> in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
</verse><verse>Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
</verse><verse>The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&#x2019;s milk.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
</verse><verse>Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name <supplied>is</supplied> in him.
</verse><verse>But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
</verse><verse>For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
</verse><verse>And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
</verse><verse>I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
</verse><verse>And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
</verse><verse>I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
</verse><verse>By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
</verse><verse>And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
</verse><verse>They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
     
      </verse>
