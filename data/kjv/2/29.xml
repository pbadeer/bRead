<supplied>that</supplied> which is for his sons:
</verse><verse>And it shall be Aaron&#x2019;s and his sons&#x2019; by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it <supplied>is</supplied> an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, <supplied>even</supplied>
their heave offering unto the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons&#x2019; after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

      </verse>
      <verse>And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.

</verse><verse>And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate <supplied>and</supplied> to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat <supplied>thereof,</supplied> because they <supplied>are</supplied> holy.
</verse><verse>And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it <supplied>is</supplied> holy.
</verse><verse>And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all <supplied>things</supplied> which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt offer every day a bullock <supplied>for</supplied> a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

      </verse>
      <verse>Now this <supplied>is that</supplied> which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.

</verse><verse>And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
</verse><verse><supplied>This shall be</supplied> a continual burnt offering throughout your generations <supplied>at</supplied> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.
</verse><verse>And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and <supplied>the tabernacle</supplied> shall be sanctified by my glory.
</verse><verse>And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest&#x2019;s office.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
</verse><verse>And they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD their God.
