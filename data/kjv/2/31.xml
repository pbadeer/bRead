      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</verse><verse>See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

</verse><verse>To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
</verse><verse>And in cutting of stones, to set <supplied>them,</supplied> and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
</verse><verse>And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;
</verse><verse>The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that <supplied>is</supplied> thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
</verse><verse>And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
</verse><verse>And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,
</verse><verse>And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest&#x2019;s office,
</verse><verse>And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy <supplied>place:</supplied> according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
</verse><verse>Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD that doth sanctify you.
</verse><verse>Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it <supplied>is</supplied> holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth <supplied>any</supplied> work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
</verse><verse>Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth <supplied>any</supplied> work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
</verse><verse>Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, <supplied>for</supplied> a perpetual covenant.
</verse><verse>It <supplied>is</supplied> a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for <supplied>in</supplied> six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
