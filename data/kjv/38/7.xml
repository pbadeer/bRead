      <verse>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <supplied>that</supplied> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth <supplied>day</supplied> of the ninth month, <supplied>even</supplied> in Chisleu;
</verse><verse>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,
</verse><verse><supplied>And</supplied> to speak unto the priests which <supplied>were</supplied> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <supplied>month,</supplied> even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <supplied>even</supplied> to me?
</verse><verse>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <supplied>for yourselves,</supplied> and drink <supplied>for yourselves? </supplied></verse><verse><supplied>Should ye</supplied> not <supplied>hear</supplied> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was
inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <supplied>men</supplied> inhabited the south and the plain?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,
</verse><verse>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:
</verse><verse>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
</verse><verse>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
</verse><verse>Yea, they made their hearts <supplied>as</supplied> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.
</verse><verse>Therefore it is come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:
</verse><verse>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
