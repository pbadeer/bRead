      <verse>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
</verse><verse>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>There is</supplied> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
</verse><verse>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.
</verse><verse>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour&#x2019;s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver
<supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <supplied>even</supplied> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
</verse><verse>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
</verse><verse>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And I took my staff, <supplied>even</supplied> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
</verse><verse>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <supplied>was</supplied> the word of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <supplied>me</supplied> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <supplied>pieces</supplied> of silver.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <supplied>pieces</supplied> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
</verse><verse>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <supplied>even</supplied> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
</verse><verse>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <supplied>which</supplied> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and
tear their claws in pieces.
</verse><verse>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
