      <verse>And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <supplied>that</supplied> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
</verse><verse>And he said, The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
</verse><verse>The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <supplied>he is</supplied> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
</verse><verse>I will call on the LORD, <supplied>who is</supplied> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
</verse><verse>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
</verse><verse>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
</verse><verse>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <supplied>did enter</supplied> into his ears.
</verse><verse>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
</verse><verse>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
</verse><verse>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <supplied>was</supplied> under his feet.
</verse><verse>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
</verse><verse>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, <supplied>and</supplied> thick clouds of the skies.
</verse><verse>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
</verse><verse>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
</verse><verse>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
</verse><verse>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
</verse><verse>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
</verse><verse>He delivered me from my strong enemy, <supplied>and</supplied> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
</verse><verse>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
</verse><verse>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
</verse><verse>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
</verse><verse>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
</verse><verse>For all his judgments <supplied>were</supplied> before me: and <supplied>as for</supplied> his statutes, I did not depart from them.
</verse><verse>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
</verse><verse>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
</verse><verse>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <supplied>and</supplied> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
</verse><verse>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
</verse><verse>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes <supplied>are</supplied> upon the haughty, <supplied>that</supplied> thou mayest bring <supplied>them</supplied> down.
</verse><verse>For thou <supplied>art</supplied> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
</verse><verse>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
</verse><verse><supplied>As for</supplied> God, his way <supplied>is</supplied> perfect; the word of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> tried: he <supplied>is</supplied> a buckler to all them that trust in him.
</verse><verse>For who <supplied>is</supplied> God, save the LORD? and who <supplied>is</supplied> a rock, save our God?
</verse><verse>God <supplied>is</supplied> my strength <supplied>and</supplied> power: and he maketh my way perfect.
</verse><verse>He maketh my feet like hinds <supplied>feet:</supplied> and setteth me upon my high places.
</verse><verse>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
</verse><verse>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
</verse><verse>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
</verse><verse>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
</verse><verse>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
</verse><verse>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
</verse><verse>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
</verse><verse>They looked, but <supplied>there was</supplied> none to save; <supplied>even</supplied> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
</verse><verse>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, <supplied>and</supplied> did spread them abroad.
</verse><verse>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me <supplied>to be</supplied> head of the heathen: a people <supplied>which</supplied> I knew not shall serve me.
</verse><verse>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
</verse><verse>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
</verse><verse>The LORD liveth; and blessed <supplied>be</supplied> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
</verse><verse>It <supplied>is</supplied> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
</verse><verse>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
</verse><verse>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
</verse><verse><supplied>He is</supplied> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
