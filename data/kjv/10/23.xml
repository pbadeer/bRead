      <verse>Now these <supplied>be</supplied> the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man <supplied>who was</supplied> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
</verse><verse>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <supplied>was</supplied> in my tongue.
</verse><verse>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <supplied>must be</supplied> just, ruling in the fear of God.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>he shall be</supplied> as the light of the morning, <supplied>when</supplied> the sun riseth, <supplied>even</supplied> a morning without clouds; <supplied>as</supplied> the tender grass <supplied>springing</supplied> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
</verse><verse>Although my house <supplied>be</supplied> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <supplied>things,</supplied> and sure: for <supplied>this is</supplied> all my salvation, and all <supplied>my</supplied> desire, although he make <supplied>it</supplied> not to
grow.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But <supplied>the sons</supplied> of Belial <supplied>shall be</supplied> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
</verse><verse>But the man <supplied>that</supplied> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <supplied>same</supplied> place.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>These <supplied>be</supplied> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <supplied>was</supplied> Adino the Eznite: <supplied>he lift up his spear</supplied> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
</verse><verse>And after him <supplied>was</supplied> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <supplied>one</supplied> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <supplied>that</supplied> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
</verse><verse>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
</verse><verse>And after him <supplied>was</supplied> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
</verse><verse>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
</verse><verse>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
</verse><verse>And David <supplied>was</supplied> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <supplied>was</supplied> then <supplied>in</supplied> Bethlehem.
</verse><verse>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the gate!
</verse><verse>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <supplied>was</supplied> by the gate, and took <supplied>it,</supplied> and brought <supplied>it</supplied> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but
poured it out unto the LORD.
</verse><verse>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: <supplied>is not this</supplied> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
</verse><verse>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, <supplied>and</supplied> slew <supplied>them,</supplied> and had the name among three.
</verse><verse>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the <supplied>first</supplied> three.
</verse><verse>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
</verse><verse>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&#x2019;s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
</verse><verse>These <supplied>things</supplied> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
</verse><verse>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the <supplied>first</supplied> three. And David set him over his guard.
