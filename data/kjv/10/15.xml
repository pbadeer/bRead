      <verse>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
</verse><verse>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <supplied>art</supplied> thou? And he said, Thy
servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
</verse><verse>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <supplied>are</supplied> good and right; but <supplied>there is</supplied> no man <supplied>deputed</supplied> of the king to hear thee.
</verse><verse>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
</verse><verse>And it was <supplied>so,</supplied> that when any man came nigh <supplied>to him</supplied> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
</verse><verse>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.
</verse><verse>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
</verse><verse>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <supplied>that were</supplied> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
</verse><verse>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#x2019;s counsellor, from his city, <supplied>even</supplied> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
</verse><verse>And David said unto all his servants that <supplied>were</supplied> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <supplied>else</supplied> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the
city with the edge of the sword.
</verse><verse>And the king&#x2019;s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <supplied>are ready to do</supplied> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
</verse><verse>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <supplied>which were</supplied> concubines, to keep the house.
</verse><verse>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
</verse><verse>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <supplied>art</supplied> a stranger, and also an exile.
</verse><verse>Whereas thou camest <supplied>but</supplied> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <supplied>be</supplied> with thee.
</verse><verse>And Ittai answered the king, and said, <supplied>As</supplied> the LORD liveth, and <supplied>as</supplied> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
</verse><verse>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <supplied>were</supplied> with him.
</verse><verse>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <supplied>were</supplied> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
</verse><verse>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <supplied>both</supplied> it, and his habitation:
</verse><verse>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <supplied>here am</supplied> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
</verse><verse>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <supplied>Art not</supplied> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
</verse><verse>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
</verse><verse>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And David went up by the ascent of <supplied>mount</supplied> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <supplied>was</supplied> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went
up.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And <supplied>one</supplied> told David, saying, Ahithophel <supplied>is</supplied> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, that <supplied>when</supplied> David was come to the top <supplied>of the mount,</supplied> where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
</verse><verse>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
</verse><verse>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <supplied>as</supplied> I <supplied>have been</supplied> thy father&#x2019;s servant hitherto, so <supplied>will</supplied> I now also <supplied>be</supplied> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of
Ahithophel.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>hast thou</supplied> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <supplied>that</supplied> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king&#x2019;s house, thou shalt tell <supplied>it</supplied> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
</verse><verse>Behold, <supplied>they have</supplied> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok&#x2019;s <supplied>son,</supplied> and Jonathan Abiathar&#x2019;s <supplied>son;</supplied> and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
</verse><verse>So Hushai David&#x2019;s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
