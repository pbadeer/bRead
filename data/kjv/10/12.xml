      <verse>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
</verse><verse>The rich <supplied>man</supplied> had exceeding many flocks and herds:
</verse><verse>But the poor <supplied>man</supplied> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was
unto him as a daughter.
</verse><verse>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man&#x2019;s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
</verse><verse>And David&#x2019;s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <supplied>thing</supplied> shall surely die:
</verse><verse>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Nathan said to David, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
</verse><verse>And I gave thee thy master&#x2019;s house, and thy master&#x2019;s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <supplied>that had been</supplied> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
</verse><verse>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <supplied>to be</supplied> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
</verse><verse>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <supplied>them</supplied> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
</verse><verse>For thou didst <supplied>it</supplied> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
</verse><verse>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
</verse><verse>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also <supplied>that is</supplied> born unto thee shall surely die.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah&#x2019;s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
</verse><verse>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And the elders of his house arose, <supplied>and went</supplied> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
</verse><verse>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
</verse><verse>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <supplied>himself,</supplied> and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did
eat.
</verse><verse>Then said his servants unto him, What thing <supplied>is</supplied> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <supplied>while it was</supplied> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
</verse><verse>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <supplied>whether</supplied> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
</verse><verse>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
</verse><verse>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
</verse><verse>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
</verse><verse>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
</verse><verse>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
</verse><verse>And he took their king&#x2019;s crown from off his head, the weight whereof <supplied>was</supplied> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <supplied>set</supplied> on David&#x2019;s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
</verse><verse>And he brought forth the people that <supplied>were</supplied> therein, and put <supplied>them</supplied> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of
Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
