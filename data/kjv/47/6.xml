      <verse>We then, <supplied>as</supplied> workers together <supplied>with him,</supplied> beseech <supplied>you</supplied> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
</verse><verse>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <supplied>is</supplied> the accepted time; behold, now <supplied>is</supplied> the day of salvation.)
</verse><verse>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
</verse><verse>But in all <supplied>things</supplied> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
</verse><verse>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
</verse><verse>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
</verse><verse>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
</verse><verse>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <supplied>yet</supplied> true;
</verse><verse>As unknown, and <supplied>yet</supplied> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
</verse><verse>As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <supplied>yet</supplied> possessing all things.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>O <supplied>ye</supplied> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
</verse><verse>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
</verse><verse>Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <supplied>my</supplied> children,) be ye also enlarged.
</verse><verse>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
</verse><verse>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
</verse><verse>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <supplied>them;</supplied> and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
</verse><verse>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <supplied>thing;</supplied> and I will receive you,
</verse><verse>And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
