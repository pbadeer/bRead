      <verse>Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <supplied>am</supplied> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
</verse><verse>But I beseech <supplied>you,</supplied> that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
</verse><verse>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
</verse><verse>(For the weapons of our warfare <supplied>are</supplied> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
</verse><verse>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
</verse><verse>And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
</verse><verse>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ&#x2019;s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <supplied>is</supplied> Christ&#x2019;s, even so <supplied>are</supplied> we Christ&#x2019;s.
</verse><verse>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
</verse><verse>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>his</supplied> letters, say they, <supplied>are</supplied> weighty and powerful; but <supplied>his</supplied> bodily presence <supplied>is</supplied> weak, and <supplied>his</supplied> speech contemptible.
</verse><verse>Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <supplied>will we be</supplied> also in deed when we are present.
</verse><verse>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
</verse><verse>But we will not boast of things without <supplied>our</supplied> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
</verse><verse>For we stretch not ourselves beyond <supplied>our measure,</supplied> as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <supplied>preaching</supplied> the gospel of Christ:
</verse><verse>Not boasting of things without <supplied>our</supplied> measure, <supplied>that is,</supplied> of other men&#x2019;s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
</verse><verse>To preach the gospel in the <supplied>regions</supplied> beyond you, <supplied>and</supplied> not to boast in another man&#x2019;s line of things made ready to our hand.
</verse><verse>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
</verse><verse>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
