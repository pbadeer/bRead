      <verse>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
</verse><verse>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
</verse><verse>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <supplied>the joy</supplied> of you all.
</verse><verse>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
</verse><verse>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
</verse><verse>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which <supplied>was inflicted</supplied> of many.
</verse><verse>So that contrariwise ye <supplied>ought</supplied> rather to forgive <supplied>him,</supplied> and comfort <supplied>him,</supplied> lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <supplied>your</supplied> love toward him.
</verse><verse>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
</verse><verse>To whom ye forgive any thing, I <supplied>forgive</supplied> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <supplied>it,</supplied> for your sakes <supplied>forgave I it</supplied> in the person of Christ;
</verse><verse>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
</verse><verse>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <supplied>preach</supplied> Christ&#x2019;s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
</verse><verse>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
</verse><verse>Now thanks <supplied>be</supplied> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
</verse><verse>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
</verse><verse>To the one <supplied>we are</supplied> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <supplied>is</supplied> sufficient for these things?
</verse><verse>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
