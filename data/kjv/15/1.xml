</verse><verse>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which <supplied>is</supplied> in Judah.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is there</supplied> among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he <supplied>is</supplied> the God,) which <supplied>is</supplied> in Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that <supplied>is</supplied> in Jerusalem.

      <verse>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all <supplied>them</supplied> whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which <supplied>is</supplied> in Jerusalem.
