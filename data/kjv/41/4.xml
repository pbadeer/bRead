      <verse>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
</verse><verse>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
</verse><verse><jesus>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much
earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
it, and it yielded no fruit. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>He that hath ears to
hear, let him hear. </jesus></verse><verse>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these <supplied>things</supplied> are done in parables: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing
they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <supplied>their</supplied> sins should be forgiven them. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?

      <verse>
      <jesus>The sower soweth the word. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these
are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth
for the word&#x2019;s sake, immediately they are offended. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things
entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <supplied>it,</supplied> and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

      <verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that
it should come abroad. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said, <jesus>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And should
sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when the
fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he said, <jesus>Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus><supplied>It is</supplied> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in
the earth: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. </jesus></verse><verse>And with many such parables spake he the word
unto them, as they were able to hear <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
</verse><verse>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <jesus>Let us pass over unto the other side. </jesus></verse><verse>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little
ships.
</verse><verse>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
</verse><verse>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
</verse><verse>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <jesus>Peace, be still.</jesus> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? </jesus></verse><verse>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
