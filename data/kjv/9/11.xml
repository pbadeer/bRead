</verse><verse>And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this <supplied>condition</supplied> will I make <supplied>a covenant</supplied> with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it <supplied>for</supplied> a reproach upon all Israel.
</verse><verse>And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if <supplied>there be</supplied> no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

      <verse>Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
</verse><verse>And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What <supplied>aileth</supplied> the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
</verse><verse>And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
</verse><verse>And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent <supplied>them</supplied> throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And

</verse><verse>And it was <supplied>so</supplied> on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained
were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the people said unto Samuel, Who <supplied>is</supplied> he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
</verse><verse>And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
</verse><verse>Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
</verse><verse>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
