      <verse>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
</verse><verse>Saul chose him three thousand <supplied>men</supplied> of Israel; <supplied>whereof</supplied> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
</verse><verse>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <supplied>was</supplied> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <supplied>of it.</supplied> And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
</verse><verse>And all Israel heard say <supplied>that</supplied> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <supplied>that</supplied> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <supplied>is</supplied> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash,
eastward from Beth- aven.
</verse><verse>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>some of</supplied> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <supplied>was</supplied> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <supplied>had appointed:</supplied> but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
</verse><verse>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <supplied>that</supplied> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <supplied>that</supplied> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
</verse><verse>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
</verse><verse>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
</verse><verse>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <supplied>to be</supplied> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <supplied>that</supplied> which the LORD commanded thee.
</verse><verse>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <supplied>that were</supplied> present with him, about six hundred men.
</verse><verse>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <supplied>that were</supplied> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <supplied>that leadeth to</supplied> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
</verse><verse>And another company turned the way <supplied>to</supplied> Beth-horon: and another company turned <supplied>to</supplied> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <supplied>them</supplied> swords or spears:
</verse><verse>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
</verse><verse>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
</verse><verse>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <supplied>were</supplied> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
</verse><verse>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
