      <verse>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
</verse><verse>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: <supplied>they were</supplied> judges in Beer-sheba.
</verse><verse>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
</verse><verse>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
</verse><verse>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
</verse><verse>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
</verse><verse>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
</verse><verse>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint <supplied>them</supplied> for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and <supplied>some</supplied> shall run before his chariots.
</verse><verse>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and <supplied>will set them</supplied> to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
</verse><verse>And he will take your daughters <supplied>to be</supplied> confectionaries, and <supplied>to be</supplied> cooks, and <supplied>to be</supplied> bakers.
</verse><verse>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, <supplied>even</supplied> the best <supplied>of them,</supplied> and give <supplied>them</supplied> to his servants.
</verse><verse>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
</verse><verse>And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put <supplied>them</supplied> to his work.
</verse><verse>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
</verse><verse>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
</verse><verse>That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
</verse><verse>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
