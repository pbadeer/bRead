      <verse>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <supplied>you</supplied> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <supplied>so</supplied> ye would abound more and more.
</verse><verse>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
</verse><verse>For this is the will of God, <supplied>even</supplied> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
</verse><verse>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
</verse><verse>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
</verse><verse>That no <supplied>man</supplied> go beyond and defraud his brother in <supplied>any</supplied> matter: because that the Lord <supplied>is</supplied> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
</verse><verse>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
</verse><verse>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
</verse><verse>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
</verse><verse>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
</verse><verse>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
</verse><verse>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <supplied>that</supplied> ye may have lack of nothing.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
</verse><verse>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
</verse><verse>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <supplied>and</supplied> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
</verse><verse>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
</verse><verse>Then we which are alive <supplied>and</supplied> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
</verse><verse>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
