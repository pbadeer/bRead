      <verse>Now upon the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <supplied>others</supplied> with them.
</verse><verse>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
</verse><verse>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
</verse><verse>And as they were afraid, and bowed down <supplied>their</supplied> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
</verse><verse>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
</verse><verse>Saying, <jesus>The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. </jesus></verse><verse>And they remembered his words,
</verse><verse>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
</verse><verse>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <supplied>the mother</supplied> of James, and other <supplied>women that were</supplied> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
</verse><verse>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
</verse><verse>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <supplied>about</supplied> threescore furlongs.
</verse><verse>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that, while they communed <supplied>together</supplied> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
</verse><verse>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>What manner of communications <supplied>are</supplied> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? </jesus></verse><verse>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in
Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>What things?</jesus> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
</verse><verse>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
</verse><verse>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
</verse><verse>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
</verse><verse>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
</verse><verse>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <supplied>it</supplied> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
</verse><verse>Then he said unto them, <jesus>O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? </jesus></verse><verse>And beginning at Moses and all the
prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
</verse><verse>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
</verse><verse>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <supplied>it,</supplied> and brake, and gave to them.
</verse><verse>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
</verse><verse>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
</verse><verse>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
</verse><verse>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
</verse><verse>And they told what things <supplied>were done</supplied> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <jesus>Peace <supplied>be</supplied> unto you. </jesus></verse><verse>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
</jesus></verse><verse>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <supplied>his</supplied> hands and <supplied>his</supplied> feet.
</verse><verse>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <jesus>Have ye here any meat? </jesus></verse><verse>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
</verse><verse>And he took <supplied>it,</supplied> and did eat before them.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>These <supplied>are</supplied> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <supplied>in</supplied> the prophets, and <supplied>in</supplied> the psalms,
concerning me. </jesus></verse><verse>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
</verse><verse>And said unto them, <jesus>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye are witnesses of these things.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
</verse><verse>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
</verse><verse>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
