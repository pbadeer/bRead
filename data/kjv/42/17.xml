      <verse>Then said he unto the disciples, <jesus>It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe <supplied>unto him,</supplied> through whom they come! </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the
sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

      <verse>
      <jesus>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
thou shalt forgive him. </jesus></verse><verse>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
</verse><verse>And the Lord said, <jesus>If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But which of you, having a servant
plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you,
say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.

      <verse>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
</verse><verse>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
</verse><verse>And they lifted up <supplied>their</supplied> voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
</verse><verse>And when he saw <supplied>them,</supplied> he said unto them, <jesus>Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. </jesus></verse><verse>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud
voice glorified God,
</verse><verse>And fell down on <supplied>his</supplied> face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
</verse><verse>And Jesus answering said, <jesus>Were there not ten cleansed? but where <supplied>are</supplied> the nine? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto him, <jesus>Arise, go thy way: thy
faith hath made thee whole.

      <verse>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, <jesus>The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the
kingdom of God is within you. </jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto the disciples, <jesus>The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see <supplied>it. </supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And they shall say to you, See here; or,
see there: go not after <supplied>them,</supplied> nor follow <supplied>them. </supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one <supplied>part</supplied> under heaven, shineth unto the other <supplied>part</supplied> under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his
day. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>They did eat, they drank, they married
wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
they builded; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <supplied>them</supplied> all. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>In that
day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Remember Lot&#x2019;s wife. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Whosoever shall seek to save
his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I tell you, in that night there shall be two <supplied>men</supplied> in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Two <supplied>women</supplied>
shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Two <supplied>men</supplied> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </jesus></verse><verse>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto
them, <jesus>Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
