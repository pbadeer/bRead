      <verse>And he said also unto his disciples, <jesus>There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I
am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So he called every one of his lord&#x2019;s debtors <supplied>unto him,</supplied> and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said
unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I say unto
you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the
least is unjust also in much. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <supplied>riches? </supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man&#x2019;s, who
shall give you that which is your own?

      <jesus>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </jesus></verse><verse>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard
all these things: and they derided him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The law and the prophets <supplied>were</supplied> until
John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth
another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from <supplied>her</supplied> husband committeth adultery.

      <jesus>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And
desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&#x2019;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&#x2019;s bosom: the rich man also
died, and was buried; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip
the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and
thou art tormented. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <supplied>would come</supplied> from thence. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then he
said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&#x2019;s house: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Abraham saith unto him, They
have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
