      <verse>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
</verse><verse>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
</verse><verse>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
</verse><verse>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
</verse><verse>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
</verse><verse>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <supplied>his</supplied> finger wrote on the ground, <supplied>as though he heard them not. </supplied></verse><verse>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
said unto them, <jesus>He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </jesus></verse><verse>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
</verse><verse>And they which heard <supplied>it,</supplied> being convicted by <supplied>their own</supplied> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <supplied>even</supplied> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
</verse><verse>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <jesus>Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? </jesus></verse><verse>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <jesus>Neither do I condemn thee:
go, and sin no more.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <jesus>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. </jesus></verse><verse>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself;
thy record is not true.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered and said unto them, <jesus>Though I bear record of myself, <supplied>yet</supplied> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye judge after the flesh; I
judge no man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am one that bear witness
of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <jesus>Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. </jesus></verse><verse>These
words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus again unto them, <jesus>I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, <jesus>Whither I go, ye cannot come.
</jesus></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <jesus>Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <supplied>he,</supplied> ye shall
die in your sins. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <jesus>Even <supplied>the same</supplied> that I said unto you from the beginning. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is
true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. </jesus></verse><verse>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus unto them, <jesus>When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <supplied>he,</supplied> and <supplied>that</supplied> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he that sent me is
with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. </jesus></verse><verse>As he spake these words, many believed on him.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <jesus>If ye continue in my word, <supplied>then</supplied> are ye my disciples indeed; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>They answered him, We be Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, <jesus>Ye shall be made free? </jesus></verse><verse>Jesus answered them, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <supplied>but</supplied> the Son abideth ever. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I know that ye are Abraham&#x2019;s seed; but ye seek to kill
me, because my word hath no place in you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. </jesus></verse><verse>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them,
<jesus>If ye were Abraham&#x2019;s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye do the deeds of your father.</jesus>
Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <supplied>even</supplied> God.
</verse><verse>Jesus said unto them, <jesus>If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Why do ye not understand my speech? <supplied>even</supplied> because ye cannot hear my
word. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of <supplied>your</supplied> father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own:
for he is a liar, and the father of it. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And because I tell <supplied>you</supplied> the truth, ye believe me not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that is of God
heareth God&#x2019;s words: ye therefore hear <supplied>them</supplied> not, because ye are not of God. </jesus></verse><verse>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered, <jesus>I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying,
he shall never see death. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, <jesus>If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. </jesus></verse><verse>Art thou greater than our
father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
</verse><verse>Jesus answered, <jesus>If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a
liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <supplied>it,</supplied> and was glad. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen
Abraham?
</verse><verse>Jesus said unto them, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. </jesus></verse><verse>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
