      <verse>These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
</verse><verse><jesus>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But now I go my way to him that sent
me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not
away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Of sin, because they believe not on me;
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <supplied>that</supplied> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He shall
glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <supplied>it</supplied> unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew <supplied>it</supplied> unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>A little while, and
ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. </jesus></verse><verse>Then said <supplied>some</supplied> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, <jesus>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and
again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? </jesus></verse><verse>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, <jesus>A little while?</jesus> we cannot tell what he saith.
</verse><verse>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, <jesus>Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily, verily, I
say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is
delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give <supplied>it</supplied> you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive,
that your joy may be full. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>At that day ye shall ask in my
name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I came forth from the Father, and am come into
the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. </jesus></verse><verse>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
</verse><verse>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered them, <jesus>Do ye now believe? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
