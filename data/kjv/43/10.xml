      <verse>
      <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his
voice. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. </jesus></verse><verse>This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus unto them again, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am the door: by me if any man
enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <supplied>it</supplied> more abundantly.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the
wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am the good shepherd, and know my <supplied>sheep,</supplied> and am known of mine. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>As the
Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, <supplied>and</supplied> one
shepherd. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
This commandment have I received of my Father.

      <verse>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
</verse><verse>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
</verse><verse>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
</verse><verse>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon&#x2019;s porch.
</verse><verse>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered them, <jesus>I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father&#x2019;s name, they bear witness of me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>My sheep hear my
voice, and I know them, and they follow me: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any <supplied>man</supplied> pluck them out of my hand. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>My Father, which gave <supplied>them</supplied> me, is greater than
all; and no <supplied>man</supplied> is able to pluck <supplied>them</supplied> out of my Father&#x2019;s hand. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I and <supplied>my</supplied> Father are one. </jesus></verse><verse>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered them, <jesus>Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? </jesus></verse><verse>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
man, makest thyself God.
</verse><verse>Jesus answered them, <jesus>Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath
sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know,
and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. </jesus></verse><verse>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
</verse><verse>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
</verse><verse>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
</verse><verse>And many believed on him there.
