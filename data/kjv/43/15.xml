      <jesus>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every <supplied>branch</supplied> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am the
vine, ye <supplied>are</supplied> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them,
and cast <supplied>them</supplied> into the fire, and they are burned. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
shall ye be my disciples. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father&#x2019;s commandments, and abide in his
love. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <supplied>that</supplied> your joy might be full. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Greater love hath
no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called
you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <supplied>that</supplied> your fruit should remain:
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>These things I command you, that ye love one another. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If the world hate you, ye know that <supplied>it hated</supplied> me before it hated you.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is
not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But all these things will they do unto you for my name&#x2019;s sake, because they know not him that
sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He that hateth me hateth my Father also. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If I had not done among them the works which none
other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But <supplied>this cometh to pass,</supplied> that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <supplied>even</supplied> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been
with me from the beginning.
