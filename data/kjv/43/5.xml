      <verse>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <supplied>market</supplied> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
</verse><verse>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
</verse><verse>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
</verse><verse>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
</verse><verse>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <supplied>in that case,</supplied> he saith unto him, <jesus>Wilt thou be made whole? </jesus></verse><verse>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the
pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
</verse><verse>Jesus saith unto him, <jesus>Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. </jesus></verse><verse>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <supplied>thy</supplied> bed.
</verse><verse>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, <jesus>Take up thy bed, and walk. </jesus></verse><verse>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, <jesus>Take up thy bed, and walk? </jesus></verse><verse>And he that was healed wist not who
it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <supplied>that</supplied> place.
</verse><verse>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <jesus>Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. </jesus></verse><verse>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
</verse><verse>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But Jesus answered them, <jesus>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. </jesus></verse><verse>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
</verse><verse>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For the Father
loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <supplied>them;</supplied> even so the Son quickeneth whom he
will. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That all <supplied>men</supplied> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which
hath sent him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Verily, verily, I
say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And shall come
forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine
own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But I receive not testimony from man: but
these things I say, that ye might be saved. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>But I have greater witness than <supplied>that</supplied> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the Father himself, which hath
sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <jesus>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I receive not honour from men. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But
I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I am come in my Father&#x2019;s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of
another, and seek not the honour that <supplied>cometh</supplied> from God only? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <supplied>one</supplied> that accuseth you, <supplied>even</supplied> Moses, in whom ye trust. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For had ye believed
Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
