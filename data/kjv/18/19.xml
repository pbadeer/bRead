      <verse>Then Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
</verse><verse>These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed <supplied>that</supplied> ye make yourselves strange to me.
</verse><verse>And be it indeed <supplied>that</supplied> I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
</verse><verse>If indeed ye will magnify <supplied>yourselves</supplied> against me, and plead against me my reproach:
</verse><verse>Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
</verse><verse>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but <supplied>there is</supplied> no judgment.
</verse><verse>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
</verse><verse>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <supplied>from</supplied> my head.
</verse><verse>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
</verse><verse>He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as <supplied>one of</supplied> his enemies.
</verse><verse>His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
</verse><verse>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
</verse><verse>My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
</verse><verse>They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
</verse><verse>I called my servant, and he gave <supplied>me</supplied> no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
</verse><verse>My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children&#x2019;s <supplied>sake</supplied> of mine own body.
</verse><verse>Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
</verse><verse>All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
</verse><verse>My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
</verse><verse>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
</verse><verse>Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
</verse><verse>Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
</verse><verse>That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
</verse><verse>For I know <supplied>that</supplied> my redeemer liveth, and <supplied>that</supplied> he shall stand at the latter <supplied>day</supplied> upon the earth:
</verse><verse>And <supplied>though</supplied> after my skin <supplied>worms</supplied> destroy this <supplied>body,</supplied> yet in my flesh shall I see God:
</verse><verse>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; <supplied>though</supplied> my reins be consumed within me.
</verse><verse>But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
</verse><verse>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <supplied>bringeth</supplied> the punishments of the sword, that ye may know <supplied>there is</supplied> a judgment.
