      <verse>Then Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>I know <supplied>it is</supplied> so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
</verse><verse>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
</verse><verse><supplied>He is</supplied> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened <supplied>himself</supplied> against him, and hath prospered?
</verse><verse>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
</verse><verse>Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
</verse><verse>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
</verse><verse>Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
</verse><verse>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
</verse><verse>Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
</verse><verse>Lo, he goeth by me, and I see <supplied>him</supplied> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
</verse><verse>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
</verse><verse><supplied>If</supplied> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
</verse><verse>How much less shall I answer him, <supplied>and</supplied> choose out my words <supplied>to reason</supplied> with him?
</verse><verse>Whom, though I were righteous, <supplied>yet</supplied> would I not answer, <supplied>but</supplied> I would make supplication to my judge.
</verse><verse>If I had called, and he had answered me; <supplied>yet</supplied> would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
</verse><verse>For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
</verse><verse>He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
</verse><verse>If <supplied>I speak</supplied> of strength, lo, <supplied>he is</supplied> strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time <supplied>to plead? </supplied></verse><verse>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: <supplied>if I say, I am</supplied> perfect, it shall also prove me
perverse.
</verse><verse><supplied>Though</supplied> I <supplied>were</supplied> perfect, <supplied>yet</supplied> would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> one <supplied>thing,</supplied> therefore I said <supplied>it,</supplied> He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
</verse><verse>If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
</verse><verse>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, <supplied>and</supplied> who <supplied>is</supplied> he?
</verse><verse>Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
</verse><verse>They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle <supplied>that</supplied> hasteth to the prey.
</verse><verse>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort <supplied>myself: </supplied></verse><verse>I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
</verse><verse><supplied>If</supplied> I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
</verse><verse>If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
</verse><verse>Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>he is</supplied> not a man, as I <supplied>am, that</supplied> I should answer him, <supplied>and</supplied> we should come together in judgment.
</verse><verse>Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, <supplied>that</supplied> might lay his hand upon us both.
</verse><verse>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
</verse><verse><supplied>Then</supplied> would I speak, and not fear him; but <supplied>it is</supplied> not so with me.
