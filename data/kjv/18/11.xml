      <verse>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
</verse><verse>Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
</verse><verse>Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
</verse><verse>For thou hast said, My doctrine <supplied>is</supplied> pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
</verse><verse>But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
</verse><verse>And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that <supplied>they are</supplied> double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee <supplied>less</supplied> than thine iniquity <supplied>deserveth. </supplied></verse><verse>Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou
find out the Almighty unto perfection?
</verse><verse><supplied>It is</supplied> as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
</verse><verse>The measure thereof <supplied>is</supplied> longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
</verse><verse>If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
</verse><verse>For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider <supplied>it? </supplied></verse><verse>For vain man would be wise, though man be born <supplied>like</supplied> a wild ass&#x2019;s colt.
</verse><verse>If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
</verse><verse>If iniquity <supplied>be</supplied> in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
</verse><verse>For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
</verse><verse>Because thou shalt forget <supplied>thy</supplied> misery, <supplied>and</supplied> remember <supplied>it</supplied> as waters <supplied>that</supplied> pass away:
</verse><verse>And <supplied>thine</supplied> age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
</verse><verse>And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig <supplied>about thee, and</supplied> thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
</verse><verse>Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make <supplied>thee</supplied> afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
</verse><verse>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope <supplied>shall be as</supplied> the giving up of the ghost.
