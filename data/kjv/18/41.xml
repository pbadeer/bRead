      <verse>Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord <supplied>which</supplied> thou lettest down?
</verse><verse>Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
</verse><verse>Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft <supplied>words</supplied> unto thee?
</verse><verse>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
</verse><verse>Wilt thou play with him as <supplied>with</supplied> a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
</verse><verse>Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
</verse><verse>Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
</verse><verse>Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
</verse><verse>Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not <supplied>one</supplied> be cast down even at the sight of him?
</verse><verse>None <supplied>is so</supplied> fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
</verse><verse>Who hath prevented me, that I should repay <supplied>him? whatsoever is</supplied> under the whole heaven is mine.
</verse><verse>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
</verse><verse>Who can discover the face of his garment? <supplied>or</supplied> who can come <supplied>to him</supplied> with his double bridle?
</verse><verse>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth <supplied>are</supplied> terrible round about.
</verse><verse><supplied>His</supplied> scales <supplied>are his</supplied> pride, shut up together <supplied>as with</supplied> a close seal.
</verse><verse>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
</verse><verse>They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
</verse><verse>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes <supplied>are</supplied> like the eyelids of the morning.
</verse><verse>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, <supplied>and</supplied> sparks of fire leap out.
</verse><verse>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <supplied>out</supplied> of a seething pot or caldron.
</verse><verse>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
</verse><verse>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
</verse><verse>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
</verse><verse>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <supplied>millstone. </supplied></verse><verse>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
</verse><verse>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
</verse><verse>He esteemeth iron as straw, <supplied>and</supplied> brass as rotten wood.
</verse><verse>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
</verse><verse>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
</verse><verse>Sharp stones <supplied>are</supplied> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
</verse><verse>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
</verse><verse>He maketh a path to shine after him; <supplied>one</supplied> would think the deep <supplied>to be</supplied> hoary.
</verse><verse>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
</verse><verse>He beholdeth all high <supplied>things:</supplied> he <supplied>is</supplied> a king over all the children of pride.
