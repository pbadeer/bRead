<chapter translation="KJV" testament="Old" book="Job" n="34" book-id="18">
      <verse>Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
</verse><verse>Hear my words, O ye wise <supplied>men;</supplied> and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
</verse><verse>For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
</verse><verse>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what <supplied>is</supplied> good.
</verse><verse>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
</verse><verse>Should I lie against my right? my wound <supplied>is</supplied> incurable without transgression.
</verse><verse>What man <supplied>is</supplied> like Job, <supplied>who</supplied> drinketh up scorning like water?
</verse><verse>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
</verse><verse>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
</verse><verse>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <supplied>that he should do</supplied> wickedness; and <supplied>from</supplied> the Almighty, <supplied>that he should commit</supplied> iniquity.
</verse><verse>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to <supplied>his</supplied> ways.
</verse><verse>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
</verse><verse>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
</verse><verse>If he set his heart upon man, <supplied>if</supplied> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
</verse><verse>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
</verse><verse>If now <supplied>thou hast</supplied> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
</verse><verse>Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
</verse><verse><supplied>Is it fit</supplied> to say to a king, <supplied>Thou art</supplied> wicked? <supplied>and</supplied> to princes, <supplied>Ye are</supplied> ungodly?
</verse><verse><supplied>How much less to him</supplied> that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all <supplied>are</supplied> the work of his hands.
</verse><verse>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
</verse><verse>For his eyes <supplied>are</supplied> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
</verse><verse>For he will not lay upon man more <supplied>than right;</supplied> that he should enter into judgment with God.
</verse><verse>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
</verse><verse>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <supplied>them</supplied> in the night, so that they are destroyed.
</verse><verse>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
</verse><verse>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
</verse><verse>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
</verse><verse>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth <supplied>his</supplied> face, who then can behold him? whether <supplied>it be done</supplied> against a nation, or against a man only:
</verse><verse>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
</verse><verse>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne <supplied>chastisement,</supplied> I will not offend <supplied>any more: </supplied></verse><verse><supplied>That which</supplied> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
</verse><verse><supplied>Should it be</supplied> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
</verse><verse>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
</verse><verse>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words <supplied>were</supplied> without wisdom.
</verse><verse>My desire <supplied>is that</supplied> Job may be tried unto the end because of <supplied>his</supplied> answers for wicked men.
</verse><verse>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth <supplied>his hands</supplied> among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
