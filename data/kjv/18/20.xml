      <verse>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
</verse><verse>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for <supplied>this</supplied> I make haste.
</verse><verse>I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
</verse><verse>Knowest thou <supplied>not</supplied> this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
</verse><verse>That the triumphing of the wicked <supplied>is</supplied> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <supplied>but</supplied> for a moment?
</verse><verse>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
</verse><verse><supplied>Yet</supplied> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where <supplied>is</supplied> he?
</verse><verse>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
</verse><verse>The eye also <supplied>which</supplied> saw him shall <supplied>see him</supplied> no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
</verse><verse>His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
</verse><verse>His bones are full <supplied>of the sin</supplied> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
</verse><verse>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, <supplied>though</supplied> he hide it under his tongue;
</verse><verse><supplied>Though</supplied> he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
</verse><verse><supplied>Yet</supplied> his meat in his bowels is turned, <supplied>it is</supplied> the gall of asps within him.
</verse><verse>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
</verse><verse>He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper&#x2019;s tongue shall slay him.
</verse><verse>He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
</verse><verse>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow <supplied>it</supplied> down: according to <supplied>his</supplied> substance <supplied>shall</supplied> the restitution <supplied>be,</supplied> and he shall not rejoice <supplied>therein. </supplied></verse><verse>Because he hath oppressed
<supplied>and</supplied> hath forsaken the poor; <supplied>because</supplied> he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
</verse><verse>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
</verse><verse>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
</verse><verse>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
</verse><verse><supplied>When</supplied> he is about to fill his belly, <supplied>God</supplied> shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain <supplied>it</supplied> upon him while he is eating.
</verse><verse>He shall flee from the iron weapon, <supplied>and</supplied> the bow of steel shall strike him through.
</verse><verse>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors <supplied>are</supplied> upon him.
</verse><verse>All darkness <supplied>shall be</supplied> hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
</verse><verse>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
</verse><verse>The increase of his house shall depart, <supplied>and his goods</supplied> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
