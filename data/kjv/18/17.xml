      <verse>My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves <supplied>are ready</supplied> for me.
</verse><verse><supplied>Are there</supplied> not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
</verse><verse>Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who <supplied>is</supplied> he <supplied>that</supplied> will strike hands with me?
</verse><verse>For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>He that speaketh flattery to <supplied>his</supplied> friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
</verse><verse>He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
</verse><verse>Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members <supplied>are</supplied> as a shadow.
</verse><verse>Upright <supplied>men</supplied> shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
</verse><verse>The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
</verse><verse>But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find <supplied>one</supplied> wise <supplied>man</supplied> among you.
</verse><verse>My days are past, my purposes are broken off, <supplied>even</supplied> the thoughts of my heart.
</verse><verse>They change the night into day: the light <supplied>is</supplied> short because of darkness.
</verse><verse>If I wait, the grave <supplied>is</supplied> mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
</verse><verse>I have said to corruption, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my father: to the worm, <supplied>Thou art</supplied> my mother, and my sister.
</verse><verse>And where <supplied>is</supplied> now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
</verse><verse>They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when <supplied>our</supplied> rest together <supplied>is</supplied> in the dust.
