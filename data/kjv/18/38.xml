      <verse>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
</verse><verse>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
</verse><verse>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
</verse><verse>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
</verse><verse>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
</verse><verse>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
</verse><verse>Or <supplied>who</supplied> shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <supplied>as if</supplied> it had issued out of the womb?
</verse><verse>When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
</verse><verse>And brake up for it my decreed <supplied>place,</supplied> and set bars and doors,
</verse><verse>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
</verse><verse>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; <supplied>and</supplied> caused the dayspring to know his place;
</verse><verse>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
</verse><verse>It is turned as clay <supplied>to</supplied> the seal; and they stand as a garment.
</verse><verse>And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
</verse><verse>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
</verse><verse>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
</verse><verse>Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
</verse><verse>Where <supplied>is</supplied> the way <supplied>where</supplied> light dwelleth? and <supplied>as for</supplied> darkness, where <supplied>is</supplied> the place thereof,
</verse><verse>That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths <supplied>to</supplied> the house thereof?
</verse><verse>Knowest thou <supplied>it,</supplied> because thou wast then born? or <supplied>because</supplied> the number of thy days <supplied>is</supplied> great?
</verse><verse>Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
</verse><verse>Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
</verse><verse>By what way is the light parted, <supplied>which</supplied> scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
</verse><verse>Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
</verse><verse>To cause it to rain on the earth, <supplied>where</supplied> no man <supplied>is; on</supplied> the wilderness, wherein <supplied>there is</supplied> no man;
</verse><verse>To satisfy the desolate and waste <supplied>ground;</supplied> and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
</verse><verse>Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
</verse><verse>Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
</verse><verse>The waters are hid as <supplied>with</supplied> a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
</verse><verse>Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
</verse><verse>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
</verse><verse>Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
</verse><verse>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
</verse><verse>Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we <supplied>are? </supplied></verse><verse>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
</verse><verse>Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
</verse><verse>When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
</verse><verse>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
</verse><verse>When they couch in <supplied>their</supplied> dens, <supplied>and</supplied> abide in the covert to lie in wait?
</verse><verse>Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
