      <verse>And Job answered and said,
</verse><verse>No doubt but ye <supplied>are</supplied> the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
</verse><verse>But I have understanding as well as you; I <supplied>am</supplied> not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
</verse><verse>I am <supplied>as</supplied> one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright <supplied>man is</supplied> laughed to scorn.
</verse><verse>He that is ready to slip with <supplied>his</supplied> feet <supplied>is as</supplied> a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
</verse><verse>The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth <supplied>abundantly. </supplied></verse><verse>But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
</verse><verse>Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
</verse><verse>Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
</verse><verse>In whose hand <supplied>is</supplied> the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
</verse><verse>Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
</verse><verse>With the ancient <supplied>is</supplied> wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
</verse><verse>With him <supplied>is</supplied> wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
</verse><verse>Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
</verse><verse>Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
</verse><verse>With him <supplied>is</supplied> strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver <supplied>are</supplied> his.
</verse><verse>He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
</verse><verse>He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
</verse><verse>He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
</verse><verse>He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
</verse><verse>He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
</verse><verse>He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
</verse><verse>He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them <supplied>again. </supplied></verse><verse>He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness <supplied>where there
is</supplied> no way.
</verse><verse>They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like <supplied>a</supplied> drunken <supplied>man.</supplied>
