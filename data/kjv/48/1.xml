      <verse>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
</verse><verse>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
</verse><verse>Grace <supplied>be</supplied> to you and peace from God the Father, and <supplied>from</supplied> our Lord Jesus Christ,
</verse><verse>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
</verse><verse>To whom <supplied>be</supplied> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
</verse><verse>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
</verse><verse>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
</verse><verse>As we said before, so say I now again, If any <supplied>man</supplied> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
</verse><verse>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
</verse><verse>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <supplied>it,</supplied> but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews&#x2019; religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
</verse><verse>And profited in the Jews&#x2019; religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
</verse><verse>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb, and called <supplied>me</supplied> by his grace,
</verse><verse>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
</verse><verse>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
</verse><verse>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
</verse><verse>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord&#x2019;s brother.
</verse><verse>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
</verse><verse>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
</verse><verse>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
</verse><verse>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
</verse><verse>And they glorified God in me.
