      <verse>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence <supplied>which I make</supplied> now unto you.
</verse><verse>(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
</verse><verse>I am verily a man <supplied>which am</supplied> a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, <supplied>and</supplied> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye
all are this day.
</verse><verse>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
</verse><verse>As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
</verse><verse>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <jesus>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? </jesus></verse><verse>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, <jesus>I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. </jesus></verse><verse>And they that
were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
</verse><verse>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <jesus>Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. </jesus></verse><verse>And when I could not see for the glory of that light,
being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
</verse><verse>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <supplied>there, </supplied></verse><verse>Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
</verse><verse>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
</verse><verse>For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
</verse><verse>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
</verse><verse>And saw him saying unto me, <jesus>Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. </jesus></verse><verse>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on
thee:
</verse><verse>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, <jesus>Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles. </jesus></verse><verse>And they gave him audience unto this word, and <supplied>then</supplied> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <supplied>fellow</supplied> from the earth: for it
is not fit that he should live.
</verse><verse>And as they cried out, and cast off <supplied>their</supplied> clothes, and threw dust into the air,
</verse><verse>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
</verse><verse>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
</verse><verse>When the centurion heard <supplied>that,</supplied> he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
</verse><verse>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
</verse><verse>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <supplied>free</supplied> born.
</verse><verse>Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
</verse><verse>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <supplied>his</supplied> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before
them.
