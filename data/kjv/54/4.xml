      <verse>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
</verse><verse>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
</verse><verse>Forbidding to marry, <supplied>and commanding</supplied> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
</verse><verse>For every creature of God <supplied>is</supplied> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
</verse><verse>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
</verse><verse>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
</verse><verse>But refuse profane and old wives&#x2019; fables, and exercise thyself <supplied>rather</supplied> unto godliness.
</verse><verse>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
</verse><verse>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>These things command and teach.
</verse><verse>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
</verse><verse>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
</verse><verse>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
</verse><verse>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
</verse><verse>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
