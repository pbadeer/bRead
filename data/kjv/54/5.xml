      <verse>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat <supplied>him</supplied> as a father; <supplied>and</supplied> the younger men as brethren;
</verse><verse>The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
</verse><verse>Honour widows that are widows indeed.
</verse><verse>But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
</verse><verse>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
</verse><verse>But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
</verse><verse>And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
</verse><verse>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
</verse><verse>Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
</verse><verse>Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints&#x2019; feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
</verse><verse>But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
</verse><verse>Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
</verse><verse>And withal they learn <supplied>to be</supplied> idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
</verse><verse>I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
</verse><verse>For some are already turned aside after Satan.
</verse><verse>If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
</verse><verse>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
</verse><verse>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, <jesus>The labourer <supplied>is</supplied> worthy of his reward. </jesus></verse><verse>Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
</verse><verse>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
</verse><verse>I charge <supplied>thee</supplied> before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
</verse><verse>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men&#x2019;s sins: keep thyself pure.
</verse><verse>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach&#x2019;s sake and thine often infirmities.
</verse><verse>Some men&#x2019;s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <supplied>men</supplied> they follow after.
</verse><verse>Likewise also the good works <supplied>of some</supplied> are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
