</verse><verse>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the
land shall howl.
</verse><verse>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <supplied>horses,</supplied> at the rushing of his chariots, <supplied>and at</supplied> the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <supplied>their</supplied> children for feebleness of hands;
</verse><verse>Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, <supplied>and</supplied> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.
</verse><verse>Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <supplied>with</supplied> the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
</verse><verse>O thou sword of the LORD, how long <supplied>will it be</supplied> ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
</verse><verse>How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
