      <verse>Righteous <supplied>art</supplied> thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of <supplied>thy</supplied> judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? <supplied>wherefore</supplied> are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
</verse><verse>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <supplied>art</supplied> near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
</verse><verse>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
</verse><verse>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
</verse><verse>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <supplied>if</supplied> in the land of peace, <supplied>wherein</supplied> thou trustedst, <supplied>they wearied thee,</supplied> then how wilt thou do in the swelling of
Jordan?
</verse><verse>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.

      <verse>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
</verse><verse>Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
</verse><verse>Mine heritage <supplied>is</supplied> unto me <supplied>as</supplied> a speckled bird, the birds round about <supplied>are</supplied> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
</verse><verse>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
</verse><verse>They have made it desolate, <supplied>and being</supplied> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth <supplied>it</supplied> to heart.
</verse><verse>The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <supplied>one</supplied> end of the land even to the <supplied>other</supplied> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
</verse><verse>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, <supplied>but</supplied> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
</verse><verse>But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.
