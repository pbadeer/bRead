      <verse>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus <supplied>our</supplied> brother,
</verse><verse>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace <supplied>be</supplied> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
</verse><verse>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love <supplied>which ye have</supplied> to all the saints,
</verse><verse>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
</verse><verse>Which is come unto you, as <supplied>it is</supplied> in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as <supplied>it doth</supplied> also in you, since the day ye heard <supplied>of it,</supplied> and knew the grace of God in truth:
</verse><verse>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
</verse><verse>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
</verse><verse>For this cause we also, since the day we heard <supplied>it,</supplied> do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
</verse><verse>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
</verse><verse>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
</verse><verse>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
</verse><verse>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated <supplied>us</supplied> into the kingdom of his dear Son:
</verse><verse>In whom we have redemption through his blood, <supplied>even</supplied> the forgiveness of sins:
</verse><verse>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
</verse><verse>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <supplied>they be</supplied> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
</verse><verse>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
</verse><verse>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <supplied>things</supplied> he might have the preeminence.
</verse><verse>For it pleased <supplied>the Father</supplied> that in him should all fulness dwell;
</verse><verse>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, <supplied>I say,</supplied> whether <supplied>they be</supplied> things in earth, or things in heaven.
</verse><verse>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <supplied>your</supplied> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
</verse><verse>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
</verse><verse>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and <supplied>be</supplied> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, <supplied>and</supplied> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
</verse><verse>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&#x2019;s sake, which is the church:
</verse><verse>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
</verse><verse><supplied>Even</supplied> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
</verse><verse>To whom God would make known what <supplied>is</supplied> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
</verse><verse>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
</verse><verse>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
