      <verse>I charge <supplied>thee</supplied> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
</verse><verse>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
</verse><verse>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
</verse><verse>And they shall turn away <supplied>their</supplied> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
</verse><verse>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
</verse><verse>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
</verse><verse>I have fought a good fight, I have finished <supplied>my</supplied> course, I have kept the faith:
</verse><verse>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
</verse><verse>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
</verse><verse>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
</verse><verse>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
</verse><verse>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <supplied>with thee,</supplied> and the books, <supplied>but</supplied> especially the parchments.
</verse><verse>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
</verse><verse>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
</verse><verse>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <supplied>men</supplied> forsook me: <supplied>I pray God</supplied> that it may not be laid to their charge.
</verse><verse>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <supplied>that</supplied> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
</verse><verse>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <supplied>me</supplied> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <supplied>be</supplied> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
</verse><verse>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
</verse><verse>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with thy spirit. Grace <supplied>be</supplied> with you. Amen.
