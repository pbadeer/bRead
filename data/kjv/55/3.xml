      <verse>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
</verse><verse>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
</verse><verse>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
</verse><verse>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
</verse><verse>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
</verse><verse>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
</verse><verse>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
</verse><verse>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
</verse><verse>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <supplied>men,</supplied> as theirs also was.
</verse><verse>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
</verse><verse>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <supplied>them</supplied> all the Lord delivered me.
</verse><verse>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
</verse><verse>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
</verse><verse>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <supplied>them; </supplied></verse><verse>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>All scripture <supplied>is</supplied> given by inspiration of God, and <supplied>is</supplied> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
</verse><verse>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
