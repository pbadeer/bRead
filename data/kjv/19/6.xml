      To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I <supplied>am</supplied> weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies&#x2019; sake.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For in death <supplied>there is</supplied> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return <supplied>and</supplied> be ashamed suddenly.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
