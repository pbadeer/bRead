      To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I cried unto God with my voice, <supplied>even</supplied> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <supplied>his</supplied> promise fail for evermore?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And I said, This <supplied>is</supplied> my infirmity: <supplied>but I will remember</supplied> the years of the right hand of the most High.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy way, O God, <supplied>is</supplied> in the sanctuary: who <supplied>is so</supplied> great a God as <supplied>our</supplied> God?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou <supplied>art</supplied> the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast with <supplied>thine</supplied> arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The voice of thy thunder <supplied>was</supplied> in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy way <supplied>is</supplied> in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
