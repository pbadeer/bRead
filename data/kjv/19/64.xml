      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Who whet their tongue like a sword, <supplied>and</supplied> bend <supplied>their bows to shoot</supplied> their arrows, <supplied>even</supplied> bitter words:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They encourage themselves <supplied>in</supplied> an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward <supplied>thought</supplied> of every one <supplied>of them,</supplied> and the heart, <supplied>is</supplied> deep.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But God shall shoot at them <supplied>with</supplied> an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
