      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, <supplied>if</supplied> thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief <supplied>is</supplied> in their hearts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> their strength, and he <supplied>is</supplied> the saving strength of his anointed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
