      A Song of degrees.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them be as the grass <supplied>upon</supplied> the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <supplied>be</supplied> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
