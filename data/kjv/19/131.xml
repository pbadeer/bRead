      A Song of degrees of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul <supplied>is</supplied> even as a weaned child.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
