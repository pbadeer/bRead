      To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>God <supplied>is</supplied> our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Though</supplied> the waters thereof roar <supplied>and</supplied> be troubled, <supplied>though</supplied> the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>There is</supplied> a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy <supplied>place</supplied> of the tabernacles of the most High.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, <supplied>and that</supplied> right early.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> with us; the God of Jacob <supplied>is</supplied> our refuge. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be still, and know that I <supplied>am</supplied> God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD of hosts <supplied>is</supplied> with us; the God of Jacob <supplied>is</supplied> our refuge. Selah.
