      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, Maschil.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is he whose</supplied> transgression <supplied>is</supplied> forgiven, <supplied>whose</supplied> sin <supplied>is</supplied> covered.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <supplied>there is</supplied> no guile.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be ye not as the horse, <supplied>or</supplied> as the mule, <supplied>which</supplied> have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Many sorrows <supplied>shall be</supplied> to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <supplied>ye that are</supplied> upright in heart.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
