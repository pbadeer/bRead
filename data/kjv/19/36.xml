      To the chief Musician, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, the servant of the LORD.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, <supplied>that there is</supplied> no fear of God before his eyes.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The words of his mouth <supplied>are</supplied> iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, <supplied>and</supplied> to do good.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way <supplied>that is</supplied> not good; he abhorreth not evil.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy mercy, O LORD, <supplied>is</supplied> in the heavens; <supplied>and</supplied> thy faithfulness <supplied>reacheth</supplied> unto the clouds.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy righteousness <supplied>is</supplied> like the great mountains; thy judgments <supplied>are</supplied> a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How excellent <supplied>is</supplied> thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For with thee <supplied>is</supplied> the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
