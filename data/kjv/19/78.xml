      Maschil of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Give ear, O my people, <supplied>to</supplied> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We will not hide <supplied>them</supplied> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That the generation to come might know <supplied>them, even</supplied> the children <supplied>which</supplied> should be born; <supplied>who</supplied> should arise and declare <supplied>them</supplied> to their children:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <supplied>that</supplied> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The children of Ephraim, <supplied>being</supplied> armed, <supplied>and</supplied> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <supplied>in</supplied> the field of Zoan.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <supplied>them</supplied> drink as <supplied>out of</supplied> the great depths.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore the LORD heard <supplied>this,</supplied> and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Man did eat angels&#x2019; food: he sent them meat to the full.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he let <supplied>it</supplied> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <supplied>was</supplied> yet in their mouths,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <supplied>men</supplied> of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they remembered that God <supplied>was</supplied> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But he, <supplied>being</supplied> full of compassion, forgave <supplied>their</supplied> iniquity, and destroyed <supplied>them</supplied> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he remembered that they <supplied>were but</supplied> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <supplied>and</supplied> grieve him in the desert!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They remembered not his hand, <supplied>nor</supplied> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <supplied>among them.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <supplied>their</supplied> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <supplied>even to</supplied> this mountain, <supplied>which</supplied> his right hand had purchased.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When God heard <supplied>this,</supplied> he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <supplied>which</supplied> he placed among men;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy&#x2019;s hand.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <supplied>and</supplied> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he built his sanctuary like high <supplied>palaces,</supplied> like the earth which he hath established for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
