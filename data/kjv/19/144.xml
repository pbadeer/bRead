      A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, <supplied>and</supplied> my fingers to fight:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and <supplied>he</supplied> in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, what <supplied>is</supplied> man, that thou takest knowledge of him! <supplied>or</supplied> the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Man is like to vanity: his days <supplied>are</supplied> as a shadow that passeth away.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <supplied>is</supplied> a right hand of falsehood.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery <supplied>and</supplied> an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>It is he</supplied> that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <supplied>is</supplied> a right hand of falsehood:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That our sons <supplied>may be</supplied> as plants grown up in their youth; <supplied>that</supplied> our daughters <supplied>may be</supplied> as corner stones, polished <supplied>after</supplied> the similitude of a palace:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>That</supplied> our garners <supplied>may be</supplied> full, affording all manner of store: <supplied>that</supplied> our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>That</supplied> our oxen <supplied>may be</supplied> strong to labour; <supplied>that there be</supplied> no breaking in, nor going out; that <supplied>there be</supplied> no complaining in our streets.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Happy <supplied>is that</supplied> people, that is in such a case: <supplied>yea,</supplied> happy <supplied>is that</supplied> people, whose God <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD.
