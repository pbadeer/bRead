      A Psalm.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the floods clap <supplied>their</supplied> hands: let the hills be joyful together
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
