      To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <supplied>is</supplied> ever before me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <supplied>this</supplied> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <supplied>and</supplied> be clear when thou judgest.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden <supplied>part</supplied> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Make me to hear joy and gladness; <supplied>that</supplied> the bones <supplied>which</supplied> thou hast broken may rejoice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me <supplied>with thy</supplied> free spirit.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>Then</supplied> will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: <supplied>and</supplied> my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give <supplied>it:</supplied> thou delightest not in burnt offering.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The sacrifices of God <supplied>are</supplied> a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
