      To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <supplied>for then</supplied> would I fly away, and be at rest.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lo, <supplied>then</supplied> would I wander far off, <supplied>and</supplied> remain in the wilderness. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <supplied>and</supplied> tempest.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Destroy, O Lord, <supplied>and</supplied> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <supplied>are</supplied> in the midst of it.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wickedness <supplied>is</supplied> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For <supplied>it was</supplied> not an enemy <supplied>that</supplied> reproached me; then I could have borne <supplied>it:</supplied> neither <supplied>was it</supplied> he that hated me <supplied>that</supplied> did magnify <supplied>himself</supplied> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But <supplied>it was</supplied> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We took sweet counsel together, <supplied>and</supplied> walked unto the house of God in company.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let death seize upon them, <supplied>and</supplied> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, <supplied>and</supplied> among them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <supplied>that was</supplied> against me: for there were many with me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>The words</supplied> of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <supplied>was</supplied> in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <supplied>were</supplied> they drawn swords.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
