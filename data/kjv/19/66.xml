      To the chief Musician, A Song <supplied>or</supplied> Psalm.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Say unto God, How terrible <supplied>art thou in</supplied> thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing <supplied>to</supplied> thy name. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Come and see the works of God: <supplied>he is</supplied> terrible <supplied>in his</supplied> doing toward the children of men.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He turned the sea into dry <supplied>land:</supplied> they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy <supplied>place.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Come <supplied>and</supplied> hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear <supplied>me:</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>But</supplied> verily God hath heard <supplied>me;</supplied> he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
