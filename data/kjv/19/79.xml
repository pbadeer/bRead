      A Psalm of Asaph.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <supplied>to be</supplied> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <supplied>there was</supplied> none to bury <supplied>them.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name&#x2019;s sake.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <supplied>is</supplied> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <supplied>by</supplied> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <supplied>which is</supplied> shed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
