      To the chief Musician, Maschil, A <supplied>Psalm</supplied> of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God <supplied>endureth </supplied>continually.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou lovest evil more than good; <supplied>and</supplied> lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou lovest all devouring words, O <supplied>thou</supplied> deceitful tongue.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of <supplied>thy</supplied> dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Lo, <supplied>this is</supplied> the man <supplied>that</supplied> made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <supplied>and</supplied> strengthened himself in his wickedness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But I <supplied>am</supplied> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done <supplied>it:</supplied> and I will wait on thy name; for <supplied>it is</supplied> good before thy saints.
