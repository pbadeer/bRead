        <verse>The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up <supplied>our</supplied> banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

        </verse>
        <verse>Some <supplied>trust</supplied> in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
