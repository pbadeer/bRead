        </verse>
        <verse>He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers <supplied>that</supplied> water the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

        </verse>

        </verse>
        <verse>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and <supplied>him</supplied> that hath no helper.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; <supplied>and</supplied> daily shall he be praised.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and <supplied>they</supplied> of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and <supplied>men</supplied> shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Blessed <supplied>be</supplied> the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And blessed <supplied>be</supplied> his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled <supplied>with</supplied> his glory; Amen, and Amen.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
