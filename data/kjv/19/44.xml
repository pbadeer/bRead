      To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, <supplied>what</supplied> work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>
        <supplied>How</supplied> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; <supplied>how</supplied> thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast given us like sheep <supplied>appointed</supplied> for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase <supplied>thy wealth</supplied> by their price.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>My confusion <supplied>is</supplied> continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast <supplied>us</supplied> not off for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, <supplied>and</supplied> forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies&#x2019; sake.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
