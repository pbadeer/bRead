        <verse>Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? <supplied>why</supplied> hidest thou <supplied>thyself</supplied> in times of trouble?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked in <supplied>his</supplied> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the wicked boasteth of his heart&#x2019;s desire, and blesseth the covetous, <supplied>whom</supplied> the LORD abhorreth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <supplied>after God:</supplied> God <supplied>is</supplied> not in all his thoughts.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <supplied>are</supplied> far above out of his sight: <supplied>as for</supplied> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <supplied>I shall</supplied> never <supplied>be</supplied> in adversity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <supplied>is</supplied> mischief and vanity.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He croucheth, <supplied>and</supplied> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <supplied>it.</supplied>
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast seen <supplied>it;</supplied> for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <supplied>it</supplied> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <supplied>man:</supplied> seek out his wickedness <supplied>till</supplied> thou find none.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD <supplied>is</supplied> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
