      To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Their poison <supplied>is</supplied> like the poison of a serpent: <supplied>they are</supplied> like the deaf adder <supplied>that</supplied> stoppeth her ear;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Let them melt away as waters <supplied>which</supplied> run continually: <supplied>when</supplied> he bendeth <supplied>his bow to shoot</supplied> his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>As a snail <supplied>which</supplied> melteth, let <supplied>every one of them</supplied> pass away: <supplied>like</supplied> the untimely birth of a woman, <supplied>that</supplied> they may not see the sun.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <supplied>his</supplied> wrath.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>So that a man shall say, Verily <supplied>there is</supplied> a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
