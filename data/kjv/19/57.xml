        <verse>Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until <supplied>these</supplied> calamities be overpast.

        <verse>I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth <supplied>all things</supplied> for me.

        <verse>My soul <supplied>is</supplied> among lions: <supplied>and</supplied> I lie <supplied>even among</supplied> them that are set on fire, <supplied>even</supplied> the sons of men, whose teeth <supplied>are</supplied> spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
      
      
       
        </verse>

        </verse>
        <verse>They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen <supplied>themselves.</supplied> Selah.
