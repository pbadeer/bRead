      A Song of degrees of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Peace be within thy walls, <supplied>and</supplied> prosperity within thy palaces.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For my brethren and companions&#x2019; sakes, I will now say, Peace <supplied>be</supplied> within thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
