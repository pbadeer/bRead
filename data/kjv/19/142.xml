      Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I looked on <supplied>my</supplied> right hand, and beheld, but <supplied>there was</supplied> no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <supplied>art</supplied> my refuge <supplied>and</supplied> my portion in the land of the living.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
