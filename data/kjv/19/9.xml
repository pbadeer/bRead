      To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I will praise <supplied>thee,</supplied> O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <supplied>which I suffer</supplied> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The heathen are sunk down in the pit <supplied>that</supplied> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The LORD is known <supplied>by</supplied> the judgment <supplied>which</supplied> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>The wicked shall be turned into hell, <supplied>and</supplied> all the nations that forget God.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <supplied>not</supplied> perish for ever.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Put them in fear, O LORD: <supplied>that</supplied> the nations may know themselves <supplied>to be but</supplied> men. Selah.
      
      
       
      
      
       
        </verse>
