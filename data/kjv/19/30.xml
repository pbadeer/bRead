      A Psalm <supplied>and</supplied> Song <supplied>at</supplied> the dedication of the house of David.
      
      
      
       
        <verse>I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>For his anger <supplied>endureth but</supplied> a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy <supplied>cometh</supplied> in the morning.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <supplied>and</supplied> I was troubled.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>What profit <supplied>is there</supplied> in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
      
      
       
        </verse>
        <verse>To the end that <supplied>my</supplied> glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
