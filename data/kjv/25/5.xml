      <verse>Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.
</verse><verse>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
</verse><verse>We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <supplied>are</supplied> as widows.
</verse><verse>We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
</verse><verse>Our necks <supplied>are</supplied> under persecution: we labour, <supplied>and</supplied> have no rest.
</verse><verse>We have given the hand <supplied>to</supplied> the Egyptians, <supplied>and to</supplied> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
</verse><verse>Our fathers have sinned, <supplied>and are</supplied> not; and we have borne their iniquities.
</verse><verse>Servants have ruled over us: <supplied>there is</supplied> none that doth deliver <supplied>us</supplied> out of their hand.
</verse><verse>We gat our bread with <supplied>the peril of</supplied> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
</verse><verse>Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
</verse><verse>They ravished the women in Zion, <supplied>and</supplied> the maids in the cities of Judah.
</verse><verse>Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
</verse><verse>They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
</verse><verse>The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.
</verse><verse>The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
</verse><verse>The crown is fallen <supplied>from</supplied> our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!
</verse><verse>For this our heart is faint; for these <supplied>things</supplied> our eyes are dim.
</verse><verse>Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
</verse><verse>Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
</verse><verse>Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, <supplied>and</supplied> forsake us so long time?
</verse><verse>Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
</verse><verse>But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
