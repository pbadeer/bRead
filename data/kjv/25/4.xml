      <verse>How is the gold become dim! <supplied>how</supplied> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
</verse><verse>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
</verse><verse>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people <supplied>is become</supplied> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
</verse><verse>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, <supplied>and</supplied> no man breaketh <supplied>it</supplied> unto them.
</verse><verse>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
</verse><verse>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
</verse><verse>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing <supplied>was</supplied> of sapphire:
</verse><verse>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
</verse><verse><supplied>They that be</supplied> slain with the sword are better than <supplied>they that be</supplied> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for <supplied>want of</supplied> the fruits of the field.
</verse><verse>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
</verse><verse>The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
</verse><verse>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For the sins of her prophets, <supplied>and</supplied> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
</verse><verse>They have wandered <supplied>as</supplied> blind <supplied>men</supplied> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
</verse><verse>They cried unto them, Depart ye; <supplied>it is</supplied> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <supplied>there. </supplied></verse><verse>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will
no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.
</verse><verse>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <supplied>that</supplied> could not save <supplied>us. </supplied></verse><verse>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for
our end is come.
</verse><verse>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
</verse><verse>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
