      <verse>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
</verse><verse>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <supplied>and</supplied> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
</verse><verse>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>his</supplied> brightness was as the light; he had horns <supplied>coming</supplied> out of his hand: and there <supplied>was</supplied> the hiding of his power.
</verse><verse>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
</verse><verse>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <supplied>are</supplied> everlasting.
</verse><verse>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <supplied>and</supplied> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
</verse><verse>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <supplied>was</supplied> thine anger against the rivers? <supplied>was</supplied> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <supplied>and</supplied> thy chariots of salvation?
</verse><verse>Thy bow was made quite naked, <supplied>according</supplied> to the oaths of the tribes, <supplied>even thy</supplied> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
</verse><verse>The mountains saw thee, <supplied>and</supplied> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <supplied>and</supplied> lifted up his hands on high.
</verse><verse>The sun <supplied>and</supplied> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <supplied>and</supplied> at the shining of thy glittering spear.
</verse><verse>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
</verse><verse>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <supplied>even</supplied> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
</verse><verse>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <supplied>was</supplied> as to devour the poor secretly.
</verse><verse>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <supplied>through</supplied> the heap of great waters.
</verse><verse>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <supplied>shall</supplied> fruit <supplied>be</supplied> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <supplied>there shall be</supplied> no herd
in the stalls:
</verse><verse>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
</verse><verse>The LORD God <supplied>is</supplied> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds&#x2019; <supplied>feet,</supplied> and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
