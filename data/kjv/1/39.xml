      <verse>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
</verse><verse>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
</verse><verse>And his master saw that the LORD <supplied>was</supplied> with him, and that the LORD made all <supplied>that</supplied> he did to prosper in his hand.
</verse><verse>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass from the time <supplied>that</supplied> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#x2019;s house for Joseph&#x2019;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
and in the field.
</verse><verse>And he left all that he had in Joseph&#x2019;s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was <supplied>a</supplied> goodly <supplied>person,</supplied> and well favoured.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass after these things, that his master&#x2019;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
</verse><verse>But he refused, and said unto his master&#x2019;s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what <supplied>is</supplied> with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
</verse><verse><supplied>There is</supplied> none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou <supplied>art</supplied> his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, <supplied>or</supplied> to be with her.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass about this time, that <supplied>Joseph</supplied> went into the house to do his business; and <supplied>there was</supplied> none of the men of the house there within.
</verse><verse>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
</verse><verse>That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
</verse><verse>And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
</verse><verse>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
</verse><verse>And Joseph&#x2019;s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king&#x2019;s prisoners <supplied>were</supplied> bound: and he was there in the prison.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
</verse><verse>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&#x2019;s hand all the prisoners that <supplied>were</supplied> in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer <supplied>of it. </supplied></verse><verse>The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing <supplied>that was</supplied>
under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and <supplied>that</supplied> which he did, the LORD made <supplied>it</supplied> to prosper.
