      <verse>And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

</verse><verse>Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
</verse><verse>For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

</verse><verse>And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained <supplied>alive,</supplied> and they
that <supplied>were</supplied> with him in the ark.
</verse><verse>And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
