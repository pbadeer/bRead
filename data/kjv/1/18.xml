      <verse>And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
</verse><verse>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <supplied>them,</supplied> he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
</verse><verse>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
</verse><verse>Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
</verse><verse>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
</verse><verse>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <supplied>it,</supplied> and make cakes upon the hearth.
</verse><verse>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave <supplied>it</supplied> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
</verse><verse>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set <supplied>it</supplied> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they said unto him, Where <supplied>is</supplied> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
</verse><verse>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <supplied>it</supplied> in the tent door, which <supplied>was</supplied> behind him.
</verse><verse>Now Abraham and Sarah <supplied>were</supplied> old <supplied>and</supplied> well stricken in age; <supplied>and</supplied> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
</verse><verse>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
</verse><verse>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
</verse><verse>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

      <verse>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
</verse><verse>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
</verse><verse>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
</verse><verse>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
</verse><verse>And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
</verse><verse>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
</verse><verse>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <supplied>are</supplied> therein?
</verse><verse>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
</verse><verse>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
</verse><verse>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <supplied>am but</supplied> dust and ashes:
</verse><verse>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <supplied>lack of</supplied> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>And he spake unto him yet again, and said,
Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <supplied>it</supplied> for forty&#x2019;s sake.
</verse><verse>And he said <supplied>unto him,</supplied> Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <supplied>it,</supplied> if I find thirty there.
</verse><verse>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <supplied>it</supplied> for twenty&#x2019;s sake.
</verse><verse>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <supplied>it</supplied> for ten&#x2019;s sake.
</verse><verse>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
