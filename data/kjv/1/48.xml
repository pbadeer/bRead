      <verse>And it came to pass after these things, that <supplied>one</supplied> told Joseph, Behold, thy father <supplied>is</supplied> sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
</verse><verse>And <supplied>one</supplied> told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
</verse><verse>And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
</verse><verse>And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee <supplied>for</supplied> an everlasting possession.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, <supplied>are</supplied> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
</verse><verse>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, <supplied>and</supplied> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
</verse><verse>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet <supplied>there was</supplied> but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
</verse><verse>And Israel beheld Joseph&#x2019;s sons, and said, Who <supplied>are</supplied> these?
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto his father, They <supplied>are</supplied> my sons, whom God hath given me in this <supplied>place.</supplied> And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
</verse><verse>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, <supplied>so that</supplied> he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
</verse><verse>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
</verse><verse>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
</verse><verse>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel&#x2019;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel&#x2019;s right hand, and brought <supplied>them</supplied> near unto him.
</verse><verse>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim&#x2019;s head, who <supplied>was</supplied> the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh&#x2019;s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh <supplied>was</supplied> the firstborn.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
</verse><verse>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
</verse><verse>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father&#x2019;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim&#x2019;s head unto Manasseh&#x2019;s head.
</verse><verse>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this <supplied>is</supplied> the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
</verse><verse>And his father refused, and said, I know <supplied>it,</supplied> my son, I know <supplied>it:</supplied> he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of
nations.
</verse><verse>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
</verse><verse>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
</verse><verse>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
