      <verse>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
</verse><verse>And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there <supplied>were</supplied> three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone <supplied>was</supplied> upon the well&#x2019;s mouth.
</verse><verse>And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well&#x2019;s mouth in his place.
</verse><verse>And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence <supplied>be</supplied> ye? And they said, Of Haran <supplied>are</supplied> we.
</verse><verse>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know <supplied>him. </supplied></verse><verse>And he said unto them, <supplied>Is</supplied> he well? And they said, <supplied>He is</supplied> well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
</verse><verse>And he said, Lo, <supplied>it is</supplied> yet high day, neither <supplied>is it</supplied> time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go <supplied>and</supplied> feed <supplied>them. </supplied></verse><verse>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
together, and <supplied>till</supplied> they roll the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth; then we water the sheep.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father&#x2019;s sheep: for she kept them.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#x2019;s
brother.
</verse><verse>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
</verse><verse>And Jacob told Rachel that he <supplied>was</supplied> her father&#x2019;s brother, and that he <supplied>was</supplied> Rebekah&#x2019;s son: and she ran and told her father.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister&#x2019;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
</verse><verse>And Laban said to him, Surely thou <supplied>art</supplied> my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou <supplied>art</supplied> my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what <supplied>shall</supplied> thy wages <supplied>be? </supplied></verse><verse>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder <supplied>was</supplied> Leah, and the
name of the younger <supplied>was</supplied> Rachel.
</verse><verse>Leah <supplied>was</supplied> tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
</verse><verse>And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
</verse><verse>And Laban said, <supplied>It is</supplied> better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
</verse><verse>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him <supplied>but</supplied> a few days, for the love he had to her.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give <supplied>me</supplied> my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
</verse><verse>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
</verse><verse>And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid <supplied>for</supplied> an handmaid.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it <supplied>was</supplied> Leah: and he said to Laban, What <supplied>is</supplied> this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
</verse><verse>And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
</verse><verse>Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
</verse><verse>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
</verse><verse>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
</verse><verse>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when the LORD saw that Leah <supplied>was</supplied> hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel <supplied>was</supplied> barren.
</verse><verse>And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
</verse><verse>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I <supplied>was</supplied> hated, he hath therefore given me this <supplied>son</supplied> also: and she called his name Simeon.
</verse><verse>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
</verse><verse>And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
