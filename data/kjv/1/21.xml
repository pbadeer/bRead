      <verse>And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
</verse><verse>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
</verse><verse>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
</verse><verse>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
</verse><verse>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, <supplied>so that</supplied> all that hear will laugh with me.
</verse><verse>And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born <supplied>him</supplied> a son in his old age.
</verse><verse>And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the <supplied>same</supplied> day that Isaac was weaned.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
</verse><verse>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <supplied>even</supplied> with Isaac.
</verse><verse>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham&#x2019;s sight because of his son.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
</verse><verse>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he <supplied>is</supplied> thy seed.
</verse><verse>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave <supplied>it</supplied> unto Hagar, putting <supplied>it</supplied> on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of
Beer-sheba.
</verse><verse>And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
</verse><verse>And she went, and sat her down over against <supplied>him</supplied> a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against <supplied>him,</supplied> and lift up her voice, and wept.
</verse><verse>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he <supplied>is. </supplied></verse><verse>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him
in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
</verse><verse>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
</verse><verse>And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
</verse><verse>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God <supplied>is</supplied> with thee in all that thou doest:
</verse><verse>Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son&#x2019;s son: <supplied>but</supplied> according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast
sojourned.
</verse><verse>And Abraham said, I will swear.
</verse><verse>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech&#x2019;s servants had violently taken away.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I <supplied>of it,</supplied> but to day.
</verse><verse>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
</verse><verse>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
</verse><verse>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What <supplied>mean</supplied> these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
</verse><verse>And he said, For <supplied>these</supplied> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
</verse><verse>Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
</verse><verse>Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And <supplied>Abraham</supplied> planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
</verse><verse>And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines&#x2019; land many days.
