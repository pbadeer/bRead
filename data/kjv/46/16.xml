      <verse>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
</verse><verse>Upon the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <supplied>God</supplied> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
</verse><verse>And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <supplied>your</supplied> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
</verse><verse>And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
</verse><verse>Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
</verse><verse>And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
</verse><verse>For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
</verse><verse>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
</verse><verse>For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <supplied>there are</supplied> many adversaries.
</verse><verse>Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <supplied>do. </supplied></verse><verse>Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him
with the brethren.
</verse><verse>As touching <supplied>our</supplied> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
</verse><verse>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
</verse><verse>Let all your things be done with charity.
</verse><verse>I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <supplied>that</supplied> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
</verse><verse>That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <supplied>us,</supplied> and laboureth.
</verse><verse>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
</verse><verse>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
</verse><verse>All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
</verse><verse>The salutation of <supplied>me</supplied> Paul with mine own hand.
</verse><verse>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
</verse><verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with you.
</verse><verse>My love <supplied>be</supplied> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
