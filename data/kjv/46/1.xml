      <verse>Paul, called <supplied>to be</supplied> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <supplied>our</supplied> brother,
</verse><verse>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <supplied>to be</supplied> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
</verse><verse>Grace <supplied>be</supplied> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <supplied>from</supplied> the Lord Jesus Christ.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
</verse><verse>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <supplied>in</supplied> all knowledge;
</verse><verse>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
</verse><verse>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
</verse><verse>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <supplied>that ye may be</supplied> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>God <supplied>is</supplied> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <supplied>that</supplied> there be no divisions among you; but <supplied>that</supplied> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
</verse><verse>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <supplied>which are of the house</supplied> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
</verse><verse>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
</verse><verse>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
</verse><verse>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
</verse><verse>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
</verse><verse>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
</verse><verse>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
</verse><verse>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
</verse><verse>Where <supplied>is</supplied> the wise? where <supplied>is</supplied> the scribe? where <supplied>is</supplied> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
</verse><verse>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
</verse><verse>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
</verse><verse>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
</verse><verse>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
</verse><verse>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
</verse><verse>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <supplied>are called: </supplied></verse><verse>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
</verse><verse>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <supplied>yea,</supplied> and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
</verse><verse>That no flesh should glory in his presence.
</verse><verse>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
</verse><verse>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
     
      </verse>
