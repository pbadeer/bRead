      <verse>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <supplied>as </supplied>sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
</verse><verse>And though I have <supplied>the gift of</supplied> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
</verse><verse>And though I bestow all my goods to feed <supplied>the poor,</supplied> and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
</verse><verse>Charity suffereth long, <supplied>and</supplied> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
</verse><verse>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
</verse><verse>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
</verse><verse>Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
</verse><verse>Charity never faileth: but whether <supplied>there be</supplied> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <supplied>there be</supplied> tongues, they shall cease; whether <supplied>there be</supplied> knowledge, it shall vanish away.
</verse><verse>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
</verse><verse>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
</verse><verse>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
</verse><verse>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
</verse><verse>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <supplied>is</supplied> charity.
