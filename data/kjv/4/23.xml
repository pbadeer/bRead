</verse><verse>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.
</verse><verse>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon <supplied>every</supplied> altar a bullock and a ram.
</verse><verse>And the LORD put a word in Balaam&#x2019;s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
</verse><verse>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
</verse><verse>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
</verse><verse>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, <supplied>whom</supplied> the LORD hath not defied?
</verse><verse>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
</verse><verse>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth <supplied>part</supplied> of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
</verse><verse>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed <supplied>them</supplied> altogether.
</verse><verse>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
</verse><verse>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

</verse><verse>And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
</verse><verse>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
</verse><verse>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
</verse><verse>God <supplied>is</supplied> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <supplied>it?</supplied> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
</verse><verse>Behold, I have received <supplied>commandment</supplied> to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
</verse><verse>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God <supplied>is</supplied> with him, and the shout of a king <supplied>is</supplied> among them.
</verse><verse>God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
</verse><verse>Surely <supplied>there is</supplied> no enchantment against Jacob, neither <supplied>is there</supplied> any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
</verse><verse>Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat <supplied>of</supplied> the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
