</verse><verse>If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
</verse><verse>If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind <supplied>herself</supplied> by a bond, <supplied>being</supplied> in her father&#x2019;s house in her youth;
</verse><verse>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
</verse><verse>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
</verse><verse>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
</verse><verse>And her husband heard <supplied>it,</supplied> and held his peace at her in the day that he heard <supplied>it:</supplied> then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
</verse><verse>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard <supplied>it;</supplied> then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

</verse><verse>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
</verse><verse>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which <supplied>are</supplied> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard <supplied>them.
</supplied></verse><verse>But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard <supplied>them;</supplied> then he shall bear her iniquity.
</verse><verse>These <supplied>are</supplied> the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, <supplied>being yet</supplied> in her youth in her father&#x2019;s house.
