      <verse>And <supplied>when</supplied> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took <supplied>some</supplied> of them prisoners.
</verse><verse>And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
</verse><verse>And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
</verse><verse>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <supplied>there is</supplied> no bread, neither <supplied>is there any</supplied> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
</verse><verse>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
</verse><verse>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
</verse><verse>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which <supplied>is</supplied> before Moab, toward the sunrising.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
</verse><verse>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which <supplied>is</supplied> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon <supplied>is</supplied> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
</verse><verse>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
</verse><verse>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
</verse><verse>And from thence <supplied>they went</supplied> to Beer: that <supplied>is</supplied> the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
</verse><verse>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by <supplied>the direction of</supplied> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness <supplied>they went</supplied> to Mattanah:
</verse><verse>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
</verse><verse>And from Bamoth <supplied>in</supplied> the valley, that <supplied>is</supplied> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
</verse><verse>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <supplied>of</supplied> the waters of the well: <supplied>but</supplied> we will go along by the king&#x2019;s <supplied>high</supplied> way, until we be past thy borders.
</verse><verse>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
</verse><verse>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <supplied>was</supplied> strong.
</verse><verse>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
</verse><verse>For Heshbon <supplied>was</supplied> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
</verse><verse>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
</verse><verse>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <supplied>and</supplied> the lords of the high places of Arnon.
</verse><verse>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
</verse><verse>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which <supplied>reacheth</supplied> unto Medeba.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
</verse><verse>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <supplied>were</supplied> there.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
</verse><verse>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
</verse><verse>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
