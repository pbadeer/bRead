      <verse>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>I said of laughter, <supplied>It is</supplied> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
</verse><verse>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <supplied>was</supplied> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their
life.
</verse><verse>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
</verse><verse>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <supplied>kind of</supplied> fruits:
</verse><verse>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
</verse><verse>I got <supplied>me</supplied> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
</verse><verse>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <supplied>as</supplied> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
</verse><verse>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
</verse><verse>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
</verse><verse>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <supplied>was</supplied> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <supplied>there was</supplied> no profit under the sun.
</verse><verse>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <supplied>can</supplied> the man <supplied>do</supplied> that cometh after the king? <supplied>even</supplied> that which hath been already done.
</verse><verse>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
</verse><verse>The wise man&#x2019;s eyes <supplied>are</supplied> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
</verse><verse>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>there is</supplied> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <supplied>is</supplied> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <supplied>man?</supplied> as the fool.
</verse><verse>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all <supplied>is</supplied> vanity and vexation of spirit.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
</verse><verse>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <supplied>man</supplied> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <supplied>is</supplied> also vanity.
</verse><verse>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
</verse><verse>For there is a man whose labour <supplied>is</supplied> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <supplied>for</supplied> his portion. This also <supplied>is</supplied> vanity and a great evil.
</verse><verse>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
</verse><verse>For all his days <supplied>are</supplied> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>
      <supplied>There is</supplied> nothing better for a man, <supplied>than</supplied> that he should eat and drink, and <supplied>that</supplied> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <supplied>was</supplied> from the hand of God.
</verse><verse>For who can eat, or who else can hasten <supplied>hereunto,</supplied> more than I?
</verse><verse>For <supplied>God</supplied> giveth to a man that <supplied>is</supplied> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <supplied>him that is</supplied> good before God. This also <supplied>is</supplied>
vanity and vexation of spirit.
