      <verse>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
</verse><verse>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter <supplied>any</supplied> thing before God: for God <supplied>is</supplied> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
</verse><verse>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool&#x2019;s voice <supplied>is known</supplied> by multitude of words.
</verse><verse>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <supplied>he hath</supplied> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
</verse><verse>Better <supplied>is it</supplied> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
</verse><verse>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <supplied>was</supplied> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
</verse><verse>For in the multitude of dreams and many words <supplied>there are</supplied> also <supplied>divers</supplied> vanities: but fear thou God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <supplied>he that is</supplied> higher than the highest regardeth; and <supplied>there be</supplied> higher than they.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <supplied>himself</supplied> is served by the field.
</verse><verse>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <supplied>is</supplied> also vanity.
</verse><verse>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <supplied>is there</supplied> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <supplied>of them</supplied> with their eyes?
</verse><verse>The sleep of a labouring man <supplied>is</supplied> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
</verse><verse>There is a sore evil <supplied>which</supplied> I have seen under the sun, <supplied>namely,</supplied> riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
</verse><verse>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and <supplied>there is</supplied> nothing in his hand.
</verse><verse>As he came forth of his mother&#x2019;s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
</verse><verse>And this also <supplied>is</supplied> a sore evil, <supplied>that</supplied> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
</verse><verse>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and <supplied>he hath</supplied> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold <supplied>that</supplied> which I have seen: <supplied>it is</supplied> good and comely <supplied>for one</supplied> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it <supplied>is</supplied>
his portion.
</verse><verse>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this <supplied>is</supplied> the gift of God.
</verse><verse>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth <supplied>him</supplied> in the joy of his heart.
