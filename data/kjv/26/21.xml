      <verse>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <supplied>thy word</supplied> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
</verse><verse>And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I <supplied>am</supplied> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
</verse><verse>Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
</verse><verse>That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
</verse><verse>Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <supplied>thy</supplied> loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
</verse><verse>And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak
<supplied>as</supplied> water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
</verse><verse>It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, <supplied>as</supplied> every tree.
</verse><verse>And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
</verse><verse>Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <supplied>thy</supplied> thigh.
</verse><verse>Because <supplied>it is</supplied> a trial, and what if <supplied>the sword</supplied> contemn even the rod? it shall be no <supplied>more,</supplied> saith the Lord GOD.
</verse><verse>Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <supplied>thine</supplied> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <supplied>is</supplied> the sword of the great <supplied>men that are</supplied> slain, which entereth into their privy
chambers.
</verse><verse>I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that <supplied>their</supplied> heart may faint, and <supplied>their</supplied> ruins be multiplied: ah! <supplied>it is</supplied> made bright, <supplied>it is</supplied> wrapped up for the slaughter.
</verse><verse>Go thee one way or other, <supplied>either</supplied> on the right hand, <supplied>or</supplied> on the left, whithersoever thy face <supplied>is</supplied> set.
</verse><verse>I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,
</verse><verse>Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <supplied>it</supplied> at the head of the way to the city.
</verse><verse>Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
</verse><verse>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <supplied>his</supplied> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
</verse><verse>At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint <supplied>battering</supplied> rams against the gates, to cast a mount, <supplied>and</supplied> to build a fort.
</verse><verse>And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, <supplied>I say,</supplied> that ye are come to remembrance, ye
shall be taken with the hand.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity <supplied>shall have</supplied> an end,
</verse><verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <supplied>shall</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> the same: exalt <supplied>him that is</supplied> low, and abase <supplied>him that is</supplied> high.
</verse><verse>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no <supplied>more,</supplied> until he come whose right it is; and I will give it <supplied>him.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <supplied>is</supplied> drawn: for the slaughter <supplied>it is</supplied> furbished, to consume because of
the glittering:
</verse><verse>Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <supplied>them that are</supplied> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <supplied>shall have</supplied> an end.
</verse><verse>Shall I cause <supplied>it</supplied> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
</verse><verse>And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <supplied>and</supplied> skilful to destroy.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no <supplied>more</supplied> remembered: for I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it.</supplied>
