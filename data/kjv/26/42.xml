      <verse>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <supplied>was</supplied> over against the separate place, and which <supplied>was</supplied> before the building toward the north.
</verse><verse>Before the length of an hundred cubits <supplied>was</supplied> the north door, and the breadth <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits.
</verse><verse>Over against the twenty <supplied>cubits</supplied> which <supplied>were</supplied> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <supplied>was</supplied> for the utter court, <supplied>was</supplied> gallery against gallery in three <supplied>stories. </supplied></verse><verse>And before the chambers
<supplied>was</supplied> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
</verse><verse>Now the upper chambers <supplied>were</supplied> shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
</verse><verse>For they <supplied>were</supplied> in three <supplied>stories,</supplied> but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore <supplied>the building</supplied> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
</verse><verse>And the wall that <supplied>was</supplied> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits.
</verse><verse>For the length of the chambers that <supplied>were</supplied> in the utter court <supplied>was</supplied> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <supplied>were</supplied> an hundred cubits.
</verse><verse>And from under these chambers <supplied>was</supplied> the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.
</verse><verse>The chambers <supplied>were</supplied> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
</verse><verse>And the way before them <supplied>was</supplied> like the appearance of the chambers which <supplied>were</supplied> toward the north, as long as they, <supplied>and</supplied> as broad as they: and all their goings out <supplied>were</supplied> both according to their fashions, and according
to their doors.
</verse><verse>And according to the doors of the chambers that <supplied>were</supplied> toward the south <supplied>was</supplied> a door in the head of the way, <supplied>even</supplied> the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said he unto me, The north chambers <supplied>and</supplied> the south chambers, which <supplied>are</supplied> before the separate place, they <supplied>be</supplied> holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they
lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place <supplied>is</supplied> holy.
</verse><verse>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <supplied>place</supplied> into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <supplied>are</supplied> holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall
approach to <supplied>those things</supplied> which <supplied>are</supplied> for the people.
</verse><verse>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <supplied>is</supplied> toward the east, and measured it round about.
</verse><verse>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
</verse><verse>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
</verse><verse>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>He turned about to the west side, <supplied>and</supplied> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
</verse><verse>He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred <supplied>reeds</supplied> long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
