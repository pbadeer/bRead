      <verse>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
</verse><verse>And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when
they went into captivity;
</verse><verse>Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
</verse><verse>And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped <supplied>thine</supplied> hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
</verse><verse>Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know
that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.

      <verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah <supplied>is</supplied> like unto all the heathen;
</verse><verse>Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities <supplied>which are</supplied> on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
</verse><verse>Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
</verse><verse>And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
</verse><verse>And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.

      <verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy <supplied>it</supplied> for the old hatred;
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
</verse><verse>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
