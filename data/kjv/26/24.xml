      <verse>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <supplied>day</supplied> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <supplied>even</supplied> of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
</verse><verse>And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set <supplied>it</supplied> on, and also pour water into it:
</verse><verse>Gather the pieces thereof into it, <supplied>even</supplied> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <supplied>it</supplied> with the choice bones.
</verse><verse>Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, <supplied>and</supplied> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum <supplied>is</supplied> not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.
</verse><verse>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
</verse><verse>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
</verse><verse>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
</verse><verse>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
</verse><verse>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and <supplied>that</supplied> the filthiness of it may be molten in it, <supplied>that</supplied> the scum of it may be consumed.
</verse><verse>She hath wearied <supplied>herself</supplied> with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum <supplied>shall be</supplied> in the fire.
</verse><verse>In thy filthiness <supplied>is</supplied> lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
</verse><verse>I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it:</supplied> it shall come to pass, and I will do <supplied>it;</supplied> I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord
GOD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
</verse><verse>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not <supplied>thy</supplied> lips, and eat not the bread of men.
</verse><verse>So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <supplied>things are</supplied> to us, that thou doest <supplied>so? </supplied></verse><verse>Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall
fall by the sword.
</verse><verse>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover <supplied>your</supplied> lips, nor eat the bread of men.
</verse><verse>And your tires <supplied>shall be</supplied> upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
</verse><verse>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the Lord GOD.
</verse><verse>Also, thou son of man, <supplied>shall it</supplied> not <supplied>be</supplied> in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
</verse><verse><supplied>That</supplied> he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause <supplied>thee</supplied> to hear <supplied>it</supplied> with <supplied>thine</supplied> ears?
</verse><verse>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
