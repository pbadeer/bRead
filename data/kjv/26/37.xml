      <verse>The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which <supplied>was</supplied> full of bones,
</verse><verse>And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <supplied>there were</supplied> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <supplied>they were</supplied> very dry.
</verse><verse>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
</verse><verse>Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
</verse><verse>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD.
</verse><verse>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
</verse><verse>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but <supplied>there was </supplied>no breath in them.
</verse><verse>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
</verse><verse>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
</verse><verse>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
</verse><verse>And ye shall know that I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
</verse><verse>And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken <supplied>it,</supplied> and performed <supplied>it,</supplied> saith the LORD.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
</verse><verse>Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <supplied>for</supplied> all the house of Israel
his companions:
</verse><verse>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou <supplied>meanest</supplied> by these?
</verse><verse>Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which <supplied>is</supplied> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, <supplied>even</supplied> with the stick of Judah, and make them one
stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.
</verse><verse>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
</verse><verse>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
</verse><verse>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so
shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
</verse><verse>And David my servant <supplied>shall be</supplied> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
</verse><verse>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, <supplied>even</supplied> they, and their children, and their children&#x2019;s children for ever: and my servant David
<supplied>shall be</supplied> their prince for ever.
</verse><verse>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
</verse><verse>My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
</verse><verse>And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
