      <verse>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
</verse><verse>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight <supplied>thereof,</supplied> not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
</verse><verse>Neither as being lords over <supplied>God&#x2019;s</supplied> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
</verse><verse>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
</verse><verse>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all <supplied>of you</supplied> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
</verse><verse>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
</verse><verse>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
</verse><verse>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
</verse><verse>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <supplied>you. </supplied></verse><verse>To him <supplied>be</supplied> glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen.

      <verse>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
</verse><verse>The <supplied>church that is</supplied> at Babylon, elected together with <supplied>you,</supplied> saluteth you; and <supplied>so doth</supplied> Marcus my son.
</verse><verse>Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace <supplied>be</supplied> with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
