      <verse>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
</verse><verse>And Asa did <supplied>that which was</supplied> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
</verse><verse>For he took away the altars of the strange <supplied>gods,</supplied> and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
</verse><verse>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
</verse><verse>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
</verse><verse>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <supplied>them</supplied> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <supplied>while</supplied> the land <supplied>is</supplied> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought <supplied>him,</supplied> and
he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
</verse><verse>And Asa had an army <supplied>of men</supplied> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <supplied>were</supplied> mighty men of valour.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
</verse><verse>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
</verse><verse>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, <supplied>it is</supplied> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O
LORD, thou <supplied>art</supplied> our God; let not man prevail against thee.
</verse><verse>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
</verse><verse>And Asa and the people that <supplied>were</supplied> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very
much spoil.
</verse><verse>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
</verse><verse>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
