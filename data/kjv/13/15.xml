      <verse>And <supplied>David</supplied> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
</verse><verse>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
</verse><verse>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
</verse><verse>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
</verse><verse>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
</verse><verse>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
</verse><verse>And said unto them, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <supplied>both</supplied> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <supplied>the place that</supplied> I have prepared for it.
</verse><verse>For because ye <supplied>did it</supplied> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
</verse><verse>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
</verse><verse>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
</verse><verse>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <supplied>to be</supplied> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
</verse><verse>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
</verse><verse>And with them their brethren of the second <supplied>degree,</supplied> Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the
porters.
</verse><verse>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <supplied>were appointed</supplied> to sound with cymbals of brass;
</verse><verse>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
</verse><verse>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
</verse><verse>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <supplied>was</supplied> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <supplied>was</supplied> skilful.
</verse><verse>And Berechiah and Elkanah <supplied>were</supplied> doorkeepers for the ark.
</verse><verse>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah <supplied>were</supplied> doorkeepers for the ark.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
</verse><verse>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
</verse><verse>And David <supplied>was</supplied> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <supplied>had</supplied> upon him an ephod of linen.
</verse><verse>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And it came to pass, <supplied>as</supplied> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
