      <verse>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <supplied>and</supplied> with every leader.
</verse><verse>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <supplied>it seem</supplied> good unto you, and <supplied>that it be</supplied> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <supplied>that are</supplied> left in all the land of Israel, and with them
<supplied>also</supplied> to the priests and Levites <supplied>which are</supplied> in their cities <supplied>and</supplied> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
</verse><verse>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
</verse><verse>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
</verse><verse>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
</verse><verse>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <supplied>that is,</supplied> to Kirjath- jearim, which <supplied>belonged</supplied> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <supplied>between</supplied> the cherubims, whose name is called <supplied>on it.
</supplied></verse><verse>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
</verse><verse>And David and all Israel played before God with all <supplied>their</supplied> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

      <verse>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
</verse><verse>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
</verse><verse>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
</verse><verse>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <supplied>home</supplied> to me?
</verse><verse>So David brought not the ark <supplied>home</supplied> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
</verse><verse>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
