      <verse>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
</verse><verse>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
</verse><verse>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
</verse><verse>For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <supplied>execute</supplied> wrath upon him that doeth evil.
</verse><verse>Wherefore <supplied>ye</supplied> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
</verse><verse>For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God&#x2019;s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
</verse><verse>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <supplied>is due;</supplied> custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
</verse><verse>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
</verse><verse>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <supplied>there be</supplied> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
</verse><verse>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <supplied>is</supplied> the fulfilling of the law.
</verse><verse>And that, knowing the time, that now <supplied>it is</supplied> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <supplied>is</supplied> our salvation nearer than when we believed.
</verse><verse>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
</verse><verse>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
</verse><verse>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <supplied>fulfil</supplied> the lusts <supplied>thereof.</supplied>
