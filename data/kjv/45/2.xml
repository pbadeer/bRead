      <verse>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
</verse><verse>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
</verse><verse>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
</verse><verse>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
</verse><verse>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
</verse><verse>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
</verse><verse>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
</verse><verse>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
</verse><verse>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
</verse><verse>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
</verse><verse>For there is no respect of persons with God.
</verse><verse>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
</verse><verse>(For not the hearers of the law <supplied>are</supplied> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
</verse><verse>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
</verse><verse>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <supplied>their</supplied> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
</verse><verse>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
</verse><verse>And knowest <supplied>his</supplied> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
</verse><verse>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
</verse><verse>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
</verse><verse>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
</verse><verse>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
</verse><verse>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
</verse><verse>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
</verse><verse>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
</verse><verse>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
</verse><verse>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
</verse><verse>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <supplied>is that</supplied> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
</verse><verse>But he <supplied>is</supplied> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <supplied>is that</supplied> of the heart, in the spirit, <supplied>and</supplied> not in the letter; whose praise <supplied>is</supplied> not of men, but of God.
