      </verse>
      <verse>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
</verse><verse>For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
</verse><verse>For your obedience is come abroad unto all <supplied>men.</supplied> I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
</verse><verse>And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with you. Amen.

      </verse>
      <verse>Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
</verse><verse>But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
</verse><verse>To God only wise, <supplied>be</supplied> glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
