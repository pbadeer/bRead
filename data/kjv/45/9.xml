      <verse>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
</verse><verse>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
</verse><verse>For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
</verse><verse>Who are Israelites; to whom <supplied>pertaineth</supplied> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <supplied>of God,</supplied> and the promises;
</verse><verse>Whose <supplied>are</supplied> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <supplied>came,</supplied> who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <supplied>are</supplied> not all Israel, which are of Israel:
</verse><verse>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <supplied>are they</supplied> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
</verse><verse>That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <supplied>are</supplied> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
</verse><verse>For this <supplied>is</supplied> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
</verse><verse>And not only <supplied>this;</supplied> but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <supplied>even</supplied> by our father Isaac;
</verse><verse>(For <supplied>the children</supplied> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
</verse><verse>It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
</verse><verse>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>What shall we say then? <supplied>Is there</supplied> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
</verse><verse>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
</verse><verse>So then <supplied>it is</supplied> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
</verse><verse>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
</verse><verse>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <supplied>have mercy,</supplied> and whom he will he hardeneth.
</verse><verse>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
</verse><verse>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <supplied>it,</supplied> Why hast thou made me thus?
</verse><verse>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
</verse><verse><supplied>What</supplied> if God, willing to shew <supplied>his</supplied> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
</verse><verse>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
</verse><verse>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
</verse><verse>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
</verse><verse>And it shall come to pass, <supplied>that</supplied> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <supplied>are</supplied> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
</verse><verse>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
</verse><verse>For he will finish the work, and cut <supplied>it</supplied> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
</verse><verse>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
</verse><verse>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
</verse><verse>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
</verse><verse>Wherefore? Because <supplied>they sought it</supplied> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
</verse><verse>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
