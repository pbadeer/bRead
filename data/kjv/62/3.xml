      <verse>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
</verse><verse>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
</verse><verse>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
</verse><verse>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
</verse><verse>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
</verse><verse>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
</verse><verse>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
</verse><verse>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
</verse><verse>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
</verse><verse>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
</verse><verse>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
</verse><verse>Not as Cain, <supplied>who</supplied> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother&#x2019;s righteous.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
</verse><verse>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <supplied>his</supplied> brother abideth in death.
</verse><verse>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
</verse><verse>Hereby perceive we the love <supplied>of God,</supplied> because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <supplied>our</supplied> lives for the brethren.
</verse><verse>But whoso hath this world&#x2019;s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <supplied>of compassion</supplied> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
</verse><verse>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
</verse><verse>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
</verse><verse>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
</verse><verse>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <supplied>then</supplied> have we confidence toward God.
</verse><verse>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
</verse><verse>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
</verse><verse>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
