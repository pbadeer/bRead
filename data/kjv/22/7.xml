      <verse>How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince&#x2019;s daughter! the joints of thy thighs <supplied>are</supplied> like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
</verse><verse>Thy navel <supplied>is like</supplied> a round goblet, <supplied>which</supplied> wanteth not liquor: thy belly <supplied>is like</supplied> an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
</verse><verse>Thy two breasts <supplied>are</supplied> like two young roes <supplied>that are</supplied> twins.
</verse><verse>Thy neck <supplied>is</supplied> as a tower of ivory; thine eyes <supplied>like</supplied> the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose <supplied>is</supplied> as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
</verse><verse>Thine head upon thee <supplied>is</supplied> like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king <supplied>is</supplied> held in the galleries.
</verse><verse>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
</verse><verse>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters <supplied>of grapes. </supplied></verse><verse>I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of
thy nose like apples;
</verse><verse>And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth <supplied>down</supplied> sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> my beloved&#x2019;s, and his desire <supplied>is</supplied> toward me.
</verse><verse>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
</verse><verse>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, <supplied>whether</supplied> the tender grape appear, <supplied>and</supplied> the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
</verse><verse>The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates <supplied>are</supplied> all manner of pleasant <supplied>fruits,</supplied> new and old, <supplied>which</supplied> I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
