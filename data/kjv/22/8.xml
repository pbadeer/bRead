      <verse>O that thou <supplied>wert</supplied> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! <supplied>when</supplied> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
</verse><verse>I would lead thee, <supplied>and</supplied> bring thee into my mother&#x2019;s house, <supplied>who</supplied> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
</verse><verse>His left hand <supplied>should be</supplied> under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
</verse><verse>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake <supplied>my</supplied> love, until he please.
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>is</supplied> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth <supplied>that</supplied> bare thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <supplied>is</supplied> strong as death; jealousy <supplied>is</supplied> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <supplied>are</supplied> coals of fire, <supplied>which hath a</supplied> most vehement flame.
</verse><verse>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if <supplied>a</supplied> man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
</verse><verse>If she <supplied>be</supplied> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she <supplied>be</supplied> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
</verse><verse>I <supplied>am</supplied> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
</verse><verse>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <supplied>pieces</supplied> of silver.
</verse><verse>My vineyard, which <supplied>is</supplied> mine, <supplied>is</supplied> before me: thou, O Solomon, <supplied>must have</supplied> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
</verse><verse>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear <supplied>it.</supplied>
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
