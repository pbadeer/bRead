      <verse>Behold, thou <supplied>art</supplied> fair, my love; behold, thou <supplied>art</supplied> fair; thou <supplied>hast</supplied> doves&#x2019; eyes within thy locks: thy hair <supplied>is</supplied> as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
</verse><verse>Thy teeth <supplied>are</supplied> like a flock <supplied>of sheep that are even</supplied> shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none <supplied>is</supplied> barren among them.
</verse><verse>Thy lips <supplied>are</supplied> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech <supplied>is</supplied> comely: thy temples <supplied>are</supplied> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
</verse><verse>Thy neck <supplied>is</supplied> like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
</verse><verse>Thy two breasts <supplied>are</supplied> like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
</verse><verse>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
</verse><verse>Thou <supplied>art</supplied> all fair, my love; <supplied>there is</supplied> no spot in thee.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Come with me from Lebanon, <supplied>my</supplied> spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions&#x2019; dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
</verse><verse>Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, <supplied>my</supplied> spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
</verse><verse>How fair is thy love, my sister, <supplied>my</supplied> spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
</verse><verse>Thy lips, O <supplied>my</supplied> spouse, drop <supplied>as</supplied> the honeycomb: honey and milk <supplied>are</supplied> under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments <supplied>is</supplied> like the smell of Lebanon.
</verse><verse>A garden inclosed <supplied>is</supplied> my sister, <supplied>my</supplied> spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
</verse><verse>Thy plants <supplied>are</supplied> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
</verse><verse>Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
</verse><verse>A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, <supplied>that</supplied> the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
