      <verse>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
</verse><verse>And to <supplied>our</supplied> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
</verse><verse>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
</verse><verse>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
</verse><verse>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
</verse><verse>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
</verse><verse>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
</verse><verse>Yet for love&#x2019;s sake I rather beseech <supplied>thee,</supplied> being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
</verse><verse>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
</verse><verse>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
</verse><verse>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
</verse><verse>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
</verse><verse>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
</verse><verse>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
</verse><verse>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
</verse><verse>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
</verse><verse>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <supplied>thee</supplied> ought, put that on mine account;
</verse><verse>I Paul have written <supplied>it</supplied> with mine own hand, I will repay <supplied>it:</supplied> albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
</verse><verse>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
</verse><verse>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
</verse><verse>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <supplied>be</supplied> with your spirit. Amen.
