      <verse>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
</verse><verse>If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward:
</verse><verse>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
</verse><verse>Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
</verse><verse>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
</verse><verse>That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
</verse><verse>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
</verse><verse>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
</verse><verse>And to make all <supplied>men</supplied> see what <supplied>is</supplied> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
</verse><verse>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <supplied>places</supplied> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
</verse><verse>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
</verse><verse>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
</verse><verse>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
</verse><verse>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
</verse><verse>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
</verse><verse>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
</verse><verse>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
</verse><verse>May be able to comprehend with all saints what <supplied>is</supplied> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
</verse><verse>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
</verse><verse>Unto him <supplied>be</supplied> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
