      <verse>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, <supplied>that</supplied> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
</verse><verse>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller&#x2019;s field.
</verse><verse>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah&#x2019;s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph&#x2019;s son, the recorder.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
</verse><verse>I say, <supplied>sayest thou,</supplied> (but <supplied>they are but</supplied> vain words) <supplied>I have</supplied> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
</verse><verse>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <supplied>is</supplied> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
</verse><verse>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <supplied>is it</supplied> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
</verse><verse>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
</verse><verse>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master&#x2019;s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
</verse><verse>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <supplied>it:</supplied> and speak not to us in the Jews&#x2019; language, in the ears of the people that <supplied>are</supplied> on the
wall.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? <supplied>hath he</supplied> not <supplied>sent me</supplied> to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
</verse><verse>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews&#x2019; language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
</verse><verse>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
</verse><verse>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
</verse><verse>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <supplied>an agreement</supplied> with me <supplied>by</supplied> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
own cistern;
</verse><verse>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
</verse><verse><supplied>Beware</supplied> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
</verse><verse>Where <supplied>are</supplied> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <supplied>are</supplied> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
</verse><verse>Who <supplied>are they</supplied> among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
</verse><verse>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king&#x2019;s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that <supplied>was</supplied> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with <supplied>their</supplied> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
