      <verse>O LORD, thou <supplied>art</supplied> my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful <supplied>things; thy</supplied> counsels of old <supplied>are</supplied> faithfulness <supplied>and</supplied> truth.
</verse><verse>For thou hast made of a city an heap; <supplied>of</supplied> a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
</verse><verse>Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
</verse><verse>For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones <supplied>is</supplied> as a storm <supplied>against</supplied> the wall.
</verse><verse>Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; <supplied>even</supplied> the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

      <verse>And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
</verse><verse>And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
</verse><verse>He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken <supplied>it.</supplied>

      <verse>And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this <supplied>is</supplied> our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this <supplied>is</supplied> the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
</verse><verse>For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
</verse><verse>And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <supplied>his hands</supplied> to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
</verse><verse>And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, <supplied>and</supplied> bring to the ground, <supplied>even</supplied> to the dust.
