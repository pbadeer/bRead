      <verse>Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
</verse><verse>For the indignation of the LORD <supplied>is</supplied> upon all nations, and <supplied>his</supplied> fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
</verse><verse>Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
</verse><verse>And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling <supplied>fig</supplied> from the fig tree.
</verse><verse>For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
</verse><verse>The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, <supplied>and</supplied> with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
</verse><verse>And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
</verse><verse>For <supplied>it is</supplied> the day of the LORD&#x2019;S vengeance, <supplied>and</supplied> the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
</verse><verse>And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
</verse><verse>It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
</verse><verse>But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
</verse><verse>They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none <supplied>shall be</supplied> there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
</verse><verse>And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, <supplied>and</supplied> a court for owls.
</verse><verse>The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
</verse><verse>There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
</verse><verse>And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
