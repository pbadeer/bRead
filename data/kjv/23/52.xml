      <verse>Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
</verse><verse>Shake thyself from the dust; arise, <supplied>and</supplied> sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.
</verse><verse>For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
</verse><verse>Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.
</verse><verse>Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore <supplied>they shall know</supplied> in that day that I <supplied>am</supplied> he that doth speak: behold, <supplied>it is</supplied> I.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!
</verse><verse>Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

      </verse>
      <verse>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean <supplied>thing;</supplied> go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.
</verse><verse>For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel <supplied>will be</supplied> your rereward.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
</verse><verse>As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:
</verse><verse>So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for <supplied>that</supplied> which had not been told them shall they see; and <supplied>that</supplied> which they had not heard shall they consider.
