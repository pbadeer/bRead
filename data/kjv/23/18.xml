</verse><verse>That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, <supplied>saying,</supplied> Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden
down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!
</verse><verse>All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

</verse><verse>For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruninghooks, and take away <supplied>and</supplied> cut down the branches.

      <verse>In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
