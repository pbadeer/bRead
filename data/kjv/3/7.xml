</verse><verse>In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
</verse><verse>And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
</verse><verse>And the two kidneys, and the fat that <supplied>is</supplied> on them, which <supplied>is</supplied> by the flanks, and the caul <supplied>that is</supplied> above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
</verse><verse>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar <supplied>for</supplied> an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it <supplied>is</supplied> a trespass offering.
</verse><verse>Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it <supplied>is</supplied> most holy.
</verse><verse>As the sin offering <supplied>is,</supplied> so <supplied>is</supplied> the trespass offering: <supplied>there is</supplied> one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have <supplied>it. </supplied></verse><verse>And the priest that offereth any man&#x2019;s burnt offering, <supplied>even</supplied>
the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
</verse><verse>And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest&#x2019;s that offereth it.

</verse><verse>And if <supplied>any</supplied> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of

</verse><verse>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth <supplied>it</supplied> shall be cut off from his people.
</verse><verse>Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, <supplied>whether it be</supplied> of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
