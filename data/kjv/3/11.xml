      <verse>And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
</verse><verse>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <supplied>are</supplied> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <supplied>are</supplied> on the earth.
</verse><verse>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <supplied>and</supplied> cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <supplied>as</supplied> the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
</verse><verse>And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean unto you.
</verse><verse>And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean unto you.
</verse><verse>And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <supplied>is</supplied> unclean to you.
</verse><verse>Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <supplied>are</supplied> unclean to you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>These shall ye eat of all that <supplied>are</supplied> in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
</verse><verse>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which <supplied>is</supplied> in the waters, they <supplied>shall be</supplied> an abomination unto you:
</verse><verse>They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
</verse><verse>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that <supplied>shall be</supplied> an abomination unto you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And these <supplied>are they which ye</supplied> shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they <supplied>are</supplied> an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
</verse><verse>And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
</verse><verse>Every raven after his kind;
</verse><verse>And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
</verse><verse>And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
</verse><verse>And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
</verse><verse>And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
</verse><verse>All fowls that creep, going upon <supplied>all</supplied> four, <supplied>shall be</supplied> an abomination unto you.
</verse><verse>Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon <supplied>all</supplied> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;
</verse><verse><supplied>Even</supplied> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
</verse><verse>But all <supplied>other</supplied> flying creeping things, which have four feet, <supplied>shall be</supplied> an abomination unto you.
</verse><verse>And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse>And whosoever beareth <supplied>ought</supplied> of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse><supplied>The carcases</supplied> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and <supplied>is</supplied> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <supplied>are</supplied> unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
</verse><verse>And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on <supplied>all</supplied> four, those <supplied>are</supplied> unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse>And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <supplied>are</supplied> unclean unto you.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>These also <supplied>shall be</supplied> unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,
</verse><verse>And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
</verse><verse>These <supplied>are</supplied> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse>And upon whatsoever <supplied>any</supplied> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <supplied>it be</supplied> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <supplied>it be,</supplied> wherein <supplied>any</supplied> work is done, it must be
put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
</verse><verse>And every earthen vessel, whereinto <supplied>any</supplied> of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
</verse><verse>Of all meat which may be eaten, <supplied>that</supplied> on which <supplied>such</supplied> water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <supplied>such</supplied> vessel shall be unclean.
</verse><verse>And every <supplied>thing</supplied> whereupon <supplied>any part</supplied> of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; <supplied>whether it be</supplied> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: <supplied>for</supplied> they <supplied>are</supplied> unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
</verse><verse>Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <supplied>wherein there is</supplied> plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
</verse><verse>And if <supplied>any part</supplied> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it <supplied>shall be</supplied> clean.
</verse><verse>But if <supplied>any</supplied> water be put upon the seed, and <supplied>any part</supplied> of their carcase fall thereon, it <supplied>shall be</supplied> unclean unto you.
</verse><verse>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse>And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
</verse><verse>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth <supplied>shall be</supplied> an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
</verse><verse>Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon <supplied>all</supplied> four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they <supplied>are</supplied> an abomination.
</verse><verse>Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
</verse><verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <supplied>am</supplied> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
</verse><verse>For I <supplied>am</supplied> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <supplied>am</supplied> holy.
</verse><verse>This <supplied>is</supplied> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
</verse><verse>To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
