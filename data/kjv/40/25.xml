      <jesus>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And five of them were wise, and five <supplied>were</supplied> foolish. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>They that
<supplied>were</supplied> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And at midnight there was a
cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But
the wise answered, saying, <supplied>Not so;</supplied> lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him
to the marriage: and the door was shut. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Watch therefore, for ye know
neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

      <jesus>For <supplied>the kingdom of heaven is</supplied> as a man travelling into a far country, <supplied>who</supplied> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <supplied>them</supplied> other five talents. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And likewise he that
<supplied>had received</supplied> two, he also gained other two. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord&#x2019;s money. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>His lord said unto him, Well done,
<supplied>thou</supplied> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:
enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And I
was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <supplied>there</supplied> thou hast <supplied>that is</supplied> thine. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>His lord answered and said unto him, <supplied>Thou</supplied> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
gather where I have not strawed: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <supplied>then</supplied> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Take therefore the talent from him, and give
<supplied>it</supplied> unto him which hath ten talents. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And cast ye the unprofitable
servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

      <verse>
      <jesus>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as
a shepherd divideth <supplied>his</supplied> sheep from the goats: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and
ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <supplied>thee?</supplied> or thirsty, and gave <supplied>thee</supplied> drink? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>When saw we thee a
stranger, and took <supplied>thee</supplied> in? or naked, and clothed <supplied>thee? </supplied></jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have
done <supplied>it</supplied> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <supplied>it</supplied> unto me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then
shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye
did <supplied>it</supplied> not to one of the least of these, ye did <supplied>it</supplied> not to me. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
