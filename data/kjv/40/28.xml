      <verse>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
</verse><verse>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
</verse><verse>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
</verse><verse>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <supplied>men. </supplied></verse><verse>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
</verse><verse>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
</verse><verse>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
</verse><verse>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <jesus>All hail.</jesus> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
</verse><verse>Then said Jesus unto them, <jesus>Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
     
      </jesus>
      </verse>
      <verse>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
</verse><verse>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
</verse><verse>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <supplied>away</supplied> while we slept.
</verse><verse>And if this come to the governor&#x2019;s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
</verse><verse>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
</verse><verse>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
</verse><verse>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <jesus>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <supplied>even</supplied> unto the end of the world. Amen.
     
      </jesus>
