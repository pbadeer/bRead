      <verse>
      <jesus>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <supplied>that is</supplied> an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
sent them into his vineyard. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went
their way. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <supplied>that</supplied> shall ye receive. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward, Call the labourers, and give them <supplied>their</supplied> hire, beginning from the last unto the first. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when they came that <supplied>were hired</supplied> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when the first
came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Saying, These last have wrought
<supplied>but</supplied> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Take <supplied>that</supplied> thine <supplied>is,</supplied> and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>So the last
shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

      <verse>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
</verse><verse><jesus>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to
crucify <supplied>him:</supplied> and the third day he shall rise again.

      <verse>Then came to him the mother of Zebedee&#x2019;s children with her sons, worshipping <supplied>him,</supplied> and desiring a certain thing of him.
</verse><verse>And he said unto her, <jesus>What wilt thou?</jesus> She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
</verse><verse>But Jesus answered and said, <jesus>Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</jesus> They say unto him, We are able.
</verse><verse>And he saith unto them, <jesus>Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <supplied>it shall be given to them</supplied> for whom it is
prepared of my Father. </jesus></verse><verse>And when the ten heard <supplied>it,</supplied> they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
</verse><verse>But Jesus called them <supplied>unto him,</supplied> and said, <jesus>Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your minister; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
many. </jesus></verse><verse>And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
     
      </verse>
      <verse>And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <supplied>thou</supplied> Son of David.
</verse><verse>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <supplied>thou</supplied> Son of David.
</verse><verse>And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, <jesus>What will ye that I shall do unto you? </jesus></verse><verse>They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
</verse><verse>So Jesus had compassion <supplied>on them,</supplied> and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
