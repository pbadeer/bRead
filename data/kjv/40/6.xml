      <jesus>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Therefore when thou doest <supplied>thine</supplied> alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That thine
alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

      <jesus>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <supplied>are:</supplied> for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But when ye pray, use not vain
repetitions, as the heathen <supplied>do:</supplied> for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>After this
manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <supplied>it is</supplied> in heaven. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Give us this day our daily bread. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

      <jesus>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thine head, and wash thy face; </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

      <jesus>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves do not break through nor steal: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great <supplied>is</supplied> that darkness!

      <jesus>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven, <supplied>shall he</supplied> not much more <supplied>clothe</supplied> you, O ye of little faith? </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
</jesus></verse><verse><jesus>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you. </jesus></verse><verse><jesus>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day <supplied>is</supplied> the evil thereof.
